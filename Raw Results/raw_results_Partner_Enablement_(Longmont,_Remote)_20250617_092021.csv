We're Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too - driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good - you've come to the right place.

The Position:
We are seeking an Enablement & Change Management Lead to join our Customer Success Center of Excellence (COE) team. In this pivotal role, you will drive the successful adoption of new tools, processes, and systems by focusing on how changes impact our Customer Success Managers (CSMs) and Customer Success Account Leaders (CSALs). Your expertise will ensure our teams can effectively absorb and integrate evolving information into their daily workflows, rather than getting bogged down in training methodologies.

You will be responsible for translating technical systems, including Certinia (formerly FinancialForce), and evolving operational workflows into clear, actionable enablement and change initiatives. While frameworks like PROSCI provide valuable structure, this is ultimately about the practical application of change management principles and understanding how people learn and adapt to new information. You'll leverage innovative tools, including AI, to create dynamic, modular learning experiences that can be quickly updated as the business evolves.

This role collaborates closely with our Onboarding and Training Specialist, CoE Leads, AI & Technology Solutions Team, and the Process and Tools Team. Your primary goal will be to ensure that changes are understood, adopted, and seamlessly integrated across the entire Customer Success organization.

The role reports to the Senior Director, Account Success Centers of Excellence.

Key Responsibilities:
• Change Adoption & Enablement Strategy: Develop and execute strategies to ensure CSMs and CSALs effectively absorb and adopt new tools, processes, and system enhancements. Focus on practical approaches to change rather than strict adherence to formal methodologies.
• Impactful Content Creation & Communication: Create high-quality, consumable materials that simplify complex processes, tools, and systems, focusing on how these changes affect daily workflows and empower our teams. You will be responsible for developing and disseminating various change communications, including but not limited to:
• Slack messages and channels for real-time updates and quick tips.
• Email newsletters and announcements for structured information dissemination.
• Lunch and Learns (virtual and in-person) for interactive discussions and deeper dives.
• Short-form video tutorials and demonstrations.
• Internal podcasts or audio snippets for on-the-go learning.
• Knowledge base articles and FAQs for self-service support.
• Stakeholder Communication & Roadmap Updates: Effectively communicate key roadmap updates related to tools, processes, and systems to different levels of stakeholders within Account Success, ensuring alignment and understanding of upcoming changes and their impact.
• AI for Dynamic Learning: Utilize AI-based tools (content generation, adaptive learning engines, automated updates) to accelerate the development of change-focused content, personalize learning experiences, and ensure rapid content refresh cycles.
• Modular Learning Design: Build flexible frameworks that can be easily updated to reflect evolving tools, processes, and platform enhancements (with a focus on Certinia and adjacent technologies), ensuring information is digestible and actionable for our teams.
• Cross-Functional Partnership: Work closely with the Onboarding and Training Specialist, AS AI & Technology Solutions team, CSM COE Lead, and CSAL COE Leads to ensure all change enablement materials are integrated, consistent, and operationally aligned.
• Tools & Process Acumen: Maintain a deep working knowledge of Certinia and associated Customer Success tools, ensuring all change initiatives accurately reflect real-world workflows and best practices.
• Feedback & Continuous Improvement: Gather direct feedback from CSMs and CSALs to understand their adoption challenges and leverage AI-powered analytics to optimize change effectiveness and identify areas for ongoing support.

Required Skills and Qualifications:
• 3-5+ years of experience in change management, enablement, or a similar role focused on driving adoption of new systems and processes.
• Demonstrated ability to translate technical and operational complexity into clear, actionable guidance that facilitates user adoption.
• Strong knowledge of Certinia (FinancialForce) or similar CRM/PSA/ERP systems.
• Experience building dynamic, modular learning solutions that evolve and scale.
• Familiarity with AI-driven content development and learning optimization tools.
• Excellent communication skills, including the ability to simplify information and effectively convey change rationale across various communication channels (e.g., written, verbal, video, audio) to technical and non-technical audiences, and tailor messages for different stakeholder levels.
• Strong project management and cross-functional collaboration skills.
• Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience.

Preferred Qualifications:
• Certifications in Certinia, Salesforce, or relevant SaaS platforms.
• Hands-on experience implementing AI-based learning solutions for change initiatives.
• Background working in SaaS, Enterprise Customer Success, or Operations environments.
