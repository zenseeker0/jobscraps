Mark Hernandez is the S J Archuleta Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering; he directs the Environmental Engineering Microbiology and Disinfection Lab at the University of Colorado. This lab focuses on the characterization and control of microbiological air pollution and microbially induced corrosion. The lab develops genetic, biochemical and toxicological techniques to assess the efficacy of engineering interventions in sectors of sanitary engineering and industrial hygiene that are relevant to environmental health. There is special focus on aerobiology science for wide-area surveillance, indoor cleaning technology and the design of aerosol disinfection systems in the built environment.
  
  
**Responsibilities**
**What Your Key Responsibilities Will Be**
Carry out research activities under the supervision of PI Dr. Mark Hernandez.
  
  
Context: Commercial surface active agents (“Surfactants”) have been in ubiquitous residential, industrial and military use since the Second World War. These are the classes of chemicals commonly recognized by society as detergents, dispersants and wetting agents. While some surfactants occur naturally, they are dwarfed by the mass and diversity of artificial surfactants, purposely discarded to the built and natural environment. Surfactants’ emulsification properties provide the “cleaning” action for which they are valued as was evidenced by a market that reached $33B in 2104, and for which credible projections now exceed $40B by 2026. Environmental controversy surrounding surfactant use is increasing because in addition to their intrinsic toxicity, these compounds are potent activators for the diffusion and bioavailability of other environmental contaminants. Because of competition and regulatory activity, this industrial chemistry sector is responding with new generations of proprietary surfactant formulations, the environmental fate of which remain largely unknown. As a result, surfactant toxicity, degradation and emissions are receiving increased attention.
  
  
The purpose of this Postdoctoral Associate position is to establish a new, specialized analytical chemistry station within the Environmental Engineering laboratory at SEEC. This station will be dedicated to the identification and quantitation of surfactants in indoor environmental aerosol samples capable of analyzing conglomerate surfactant pools in air samples without using Mass Spectrometry (adaptive colorimetric technique). The immediate aim is to leverage the proposed analytical station to demonstrate how robust surfactant analysis can immediately complement built environment and ecological exposure studies, which are ongoing in environmental engineering.
