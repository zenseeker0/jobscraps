These questions are prepared by the H&M hiring team to assess candidates’ ability to perform the duties of the position for which they are applying. The assessment calculates your total score based on predefined point values provided by our H&M team. The hiring team will review your whole application, including your assessment score, to decide whether to advance each candidate to the next stage. Doing the assessment is optional. If you choose to complete the assessment, your score will be one factor that the hiring team considers.*

*If you have any difficulties or concerns with the online assessment method, you can request an alternative method of assessment by contacting* *recruitment\\_support@hm.com**. Choosing an alternative method will not affect your chances of being considered for the position, nor does any assessment method provide an advantage or disadvantage in the selection process. You will have the opportunity to provide optional feedback immediately after the assessment and you may always ask questions.*

*When you take the assessment, we collect your responses and use this information to evaluate your suitability for the role to which you have applied. The answers are saved in your applicant profile. We do not sell the information captured in the questionnaire and do not use any personal information to train any AI models.

The STAR technique is a structured method used to answer behavioral interview questions by clearly outlining a Situation, Task, Action, and Result. This approach helps candidates provide comprehensive and well-organized responses that showcase their skills and experiences effectively, and helps candidates provide answers that are coherent, concise, and impactful, making it easier for interviewers to assess their competencies and fit for the role. Should you advance past this stage, a job offer will be extended to you. After the offer is accepted, we conduct a background check and proceed with online onboarding.

**We will carefully review your application and contact you if we believe you are a strong match for the position.

Acceptable physical intervention techniques will be taught during our mandatory Phase I training.
