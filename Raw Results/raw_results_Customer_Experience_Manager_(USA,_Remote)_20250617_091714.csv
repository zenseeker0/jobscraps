**ABOUT NPS PHARMACY**

NPS Pharmacy (NPS) is on a mission to provide the most culturally competent pharmacy services to patients living with HIV, members of the LGBTQ+ community, communities of color, and patients of low socioeconomic status. Today, nearly 20,000 patients from Ryan White/STD Grantees, AIDS Services Organizations, and Federally Qualified Health Centers nationwide get their pharmacy services from NPS Pharmacy.

Unlike other pharmacy companies, NPS creates a nationwide network of pharmacies where every team member’s #1 priority is the patient. NPS expects every team member to always go above and beyond our industry’s standard to care for every patient—no matter who they are or where they come from. We believe this is accomplished by delivering superior clinical pharmacy service to every patient who walks through our doors.

Unlike our competitors, NPS never puts profit above patients, as our company does not have to answer private investors or venture capital firms. We see ourselves as having a bigger purpose than filling prescriptions and delivering pharmacy services. We believe it is our duty to serve our neighbors, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances as unselfishly as possible and to the highest level of service we can deliver.

**DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, & ACCESS**

NPS is unapologetically accepting and affirming diversity, equity, inclusion, and lived experiences as values shaping our future. We believe in actively fostering a culture that respects, celebrates, and values differences, serving as a catalyst to accomplishing our mission of providing culturally competent healthcare in a safe and affirming environment where all individuals feel welcome, valued, and have equal access to care and services.

**CORE BELIEFS**

1. Make decisions locally, quickly, and **always** in the best interest of patients.

2. Do everything with the highest levels of integrity.

3. Always be 100% honest and transparent.

**PHILANTHROPIC GIVING & SOCIAL IMPACT**

NPS believes in giving back to the communities that have given so much to our company and our patients over the last 23 years. Annually, NPS donates a significant share of its net income to support organizations focused on individuals living with HIV, individuals at risk of contracting HIV or STD/STIs, LGBTQ+ causes, individuals and households of lower socioeconomic status, or individuals from marginalized communities that experience discrimination and stigma.

**About Vendoroo**

Vendoroo is building the humanoid AI workforce for the built world. Our AI coworkers, or “Roos”, handle specialized operational roles like maintenance coordination, vendor communication, and resident support. They scale instantly, never churn, and execute with precision. Our customers don’t just use Vendoroo, they hire it.

We’re helping property operators replace chaos with intelligent coordination. As smart as our Roos are today, they'll always have more to learn and new opportunities to surprise and delight our customers. To maintain long-term trust and deliver ongoing value, we still need a human who can lead change, build on early successes, and act as a strategic partner to clients as their businesses grow and evolve with us.

That’s where you come in.

**The Role**

As an Account Success Associate, you’ll be the primary steward of the client relationship after onboarding and early adoption are complete. Your job: ensure every client continues to see value, deepens their knowledge and use of our Roos, and views Vendoroo as their trusted growth partner as their business evolves..

This role is a mix of project manager, product trainer, change management guide, and customer advocate. You’ll be handed the reins from our onboarding team then your goal is to maintain and expand the trust and value created during the client’s onboarding journey.

You’ll work across departments-Sales, Product, and Operations-to make sure every client utilizes best practices, maintains adoption, and understands the ROI we are delivering.

**What You’ll Own and Drive**

**Continuity of Value Post–Go-Live**  
Take over client relationships at the 90-day mark and continue to drive adoption, usage maturity, and ROI visibility well into their journey. Build upon the foundation laid during onboarding to maximize retention and long-term satisfaction.

**Client Health & Impact Measurement**  
Monitor leading indicators of client health, utilization trends, and friction points. Track and report on key metrics like NRR, feature adoption, and realized savings. Share insights regularly with clients to reinforce outcomes and identify risks early.

**Feedback & Product Advocacy**  
Serve as the client’s internal advocate. Document emerging use cases, unmet needs, and enhancement requests. Collaborate with Product and Ops to prioritize improvements that support your accounts and similar segments.

**Product Expansion & Education**  
Introduce clients to new capabilities, bundles, and workflows. Partner with Sales when it’s time to expand. Provide light-touch enablement for new features and identify training opportunities when needed.

**Strategic Account Partnering**  
Become a trusted advisor. Understand your clients’ goals, workflows, and team structure. Act as an extension of their operations team-embedding Roo more deeply into their business and driving strategic alignment.

**You Might Be a Fit If:**

* You’ve worked in a customer-facing SaaS onboarding, CX, or implementation role—ideally in a startup or high-growth environment and property management space
* You’ve worked with property operators, real estate platforms, or operationally intense industries
* You’re naturally proactive, clear in your communication, and organized under pressure
* You enjoy making customers feel smart, supported, and excited about the future
* You love to dive in and understand a product better than anyone and can turn data into action
* You understand how to actively listen and connect the dots between a real, or perceived, painpoint and product functionality.
* You get excited when a customer is facing a challenge and have a bias towards action to help them solve it. Whether it’s through product functionality or coaching them through an internal change you feel that these moments are shared wins.

**Why This Role Matters**

* You’re the ongoing connector between the customer, operations, and product. A defined point of entry of the feedback loop and a critical part of how Vendoroo maintains its competitive advantage.
* You’ll define the meaning of what ""continuity of value” and “continuity of trust” really means in property operations
* You’ll help create a repeatable, scalable account support experience for the entire company
* You’ll directly influence NPS, adoption, and retention—one account at a time
* You’ll shape how property operators transition into the age of AI teammates

**About the Permian**
---------------------

Straddling West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico over an area roughly the size of Kansas, the Permian is the most prolific oil and gas basin in America and the engine behind the country’s energy renaissance. Nationally, it provides about 40% of oil and 15% of gas production and plays a critical role in making the U.S. a leading energy exporter.

A key asset for ExxonMobil, the Basin accounts for about 40% of the Corporation’s net oil and gas production in the U.S. in 2021, with significant future growth potential. Production reached more than 550,000 barrels per day in 2022 and is expected to surpass 800,000 barrels per day by 2027. Many of these molecules travel down to ExxonMobil’s facilities along the Gulf of Mexico, where they are transformed into high-value finished products such as jet fuel and lubricants. The Permian Basin business unit also has the distinction of being the first at ExxonMobil to unveil and execute a plan for net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions in operated assets by 2030, as part of the Corporation’s broader 2050 net zero ambition.

About 800 employees of ExxonMobil’s Unconventional business line work and live in Midland, Odessa, Carlsbad and the surrounding areas, all of which offer easy access to national parks and unrivaled outdoor recreational opportunities. Employees in the area also get to enjoy the world-renowned Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, which ExxonMobil has proudly sponsored since 2019.

People who like to serve others and enjoy fast-paced environments thrive in this role. Restaurant team members normally report to a general manager, crew leader, supervisor, or owner. Many restaurant team members work full-time or part-time flexible schedules, including nights and weekends.

### **Job Duties**

* Welcome Customers

Restaurant team members set the tone for their guest’s dining experience. Some members, such as hosts and waiters, work in front facing roles. They are the first people customers meet when they walk through the door. These team members ensure that guests are quickly seated at the appropriate table. They also hand out menus and educate customers on available food options.

* Complete Food Preparation

Before a restaurant opens, restaurant team members who work behind-the-scenes, such as cooks or line prep cooks ensure that certain foods are pre-made to facilitate faster service. They may cut and prep vegetables or cook menu items that take a long time to finish.

* Serve Food to Customers

Once the food is prepared, any restaurant team member may be called upon to deliver it to a customer. Whether working in a casual dining or upscale setting, team members must pay attention to order numbers and understand seating charts to deliver the right food to the right people. To keep food service effective, team members may need to communicate with kitchen staff or management.

* Process Bill Payments

Many restaurant team members handle all forms of money during their work shift. They are required to follow appropriate cash-out procedures or use a point of sale system to record a customer’s total and help them pay their bill. They collect payments from guests, returning the appropriate amount of change.

* Clean and Set Dining Areas

Every restaurant team member works to keep up the appearance of the restaurant. During down times or in-between shifts, team members clean, sanitize, wipe down, or sweep areas where food is prepped or served. They also re-set tables, restocking dining utensils and menus to ensure every guest has what they need.

We’re a high-growth, bootstrapped HR tech startup building and selling software that helps in-house recruitment teams attract, hire, and onboard the right talent. Today, we have a strong foundation in place, with a mature product, rapid growth, strong product-market fit, and happy customers.

As our U.S. customer base grows rapidly, managing a diverse portfolio of accounts with varied needs and workflows requires focused leadership. Our talented Customer Success team is doing great work (just look at our
**G2**
and
**Capterra**
reviews), but we need a dedicated U.S.-based leader to provide focused management, drive consistent execution, and deliver strong commercial outcomes through retention, renewals, and expansion.

To that end, we’re hiring a
**Head of Customer Success, US**
to oversee our U.S.-based CSM team (currently 4 members), support 500+ customers, and deliver an excellent experience at scale. The strategy and systems are in place — we’re looking for someone to run the function day to day, coach the team, and drive retention, renewals, and expansion.

This role is ideal for a Customer Success leader ready to own and scale a growing, complex customer base. Whether you’re managing a small team and looking for your next step or have led a larger org but want to return to a hands-on, execution-focused role, this is a leadership position for someone who takes full ownership of results, loves working directly with customers and teams, and is driven by impact.

**The fine print (but way more exciting):**

* This is a remote role based in the U.S., with a few in-person team meetups each year. Our HQ is in Jersey, UK, and our 80-person team is spread across the U.K. and U.S.
* Our product is deep, flexible, and genuinely complex. At the same time, we serve a wide variety of customers across many different industries and sizes.
* Our average contract values are relatively low given the depth and complexity of our product, which means each CSM manages around 50 accounts with an average book size of $2 million ARR. Driving efficient, high-quality execution at scale is essential.
* Pinpoint isn’t for everyone. We’re still in startup mode. Things move fast, some processes are still evolving, and you’ll need to be proactive, adaptable, and hands-on.
* Our
  **values**
  shape how we work. We’re looking for people who embody these values in everything they do.

**About the Role**

You’ll be responsible for leading our U.S. Customer Success team and ensuring our customers stay successful, satisfied, and engaged. Your impact will be measured by how well you drive customer retention (GRR), revenue growth and account expansion (NRR), product adoption and onboarding effectiveness (Customer time-to-value), team performance and engagement, and overall customer health.

**This is an execution-focused role:**
you’ll drive performance, reinforce playbooks, and hold the team accountable for results. Your day-to-day responsibilities include:

* Managing and coaching a team of 4 Customer Success professionals to achieve implementation, retention, renewal, and upsell goals
* Building the muscle for renewals and upsells—ensuring each team member understands how to spot, shape, and close expansion opportunities
* Overseeing the customer experience for 500+ U.S. accounts, including managing a small book of strategic accounts
* Monitoring customer health and usage metrics to proactively address risks and drive account success
* Serving as an escalation point for high-impact customer issues
* Partnering with RevOps, the UK Head of CS, Sales, Product, and Marketing to implement playbooks, share customer insights, and support expansion
* Leading hiring and onboarding efforts as the team grows

**About You**

* Proven track record leading Customer Success teams in B2B SaaS, with experience managing CSMs focused on implementation, adoption, renewals, and expansion.
* Comfortable supporting a technically complex product with diverse customer workflows
* Strong people manager — you lead with empathy, structure, and accountability
* Proven track record of driving retention and expansion with a strong commercial mindset that understands how Customer Success impacts revenue
* Hands-on and high-agency — you’re happy rolling up your sleeves
* Excellent communicator who can influence across functions
* Deep understanding of customer value drivers and post-sale customer journeys
* Experience in a high-growth or startup environment
* Based in the U.S. (EST or CST preferred) with valid work authorization
* Proven track record of making decisions that align with our core

We’re a high-growth, bootstrapped HR tech startup building and selling software that helps in-house recruitment teams attract, hire, and onboard the right talent. Today, we have a strong foundation in place, with a mature product, rapid growth, strong product-market fit, and happy customers.

As our U.S. customer base grows rapidly, managing a diverse portfolio of accounts with varied needs and workflows requires focused leadership. Our talented Customer Success team is doing great work (just look at our
**G2**
and
**Capterra**
reviews), but we need a dedicated U.S.-based leader to provide focused management, drive consistent execution, and deliver strong commercial outcomes through retention, renewals, and expansion.

To that end, we’re hiring a
**Manager of Customer Success**
to oversee our U.S.-based CSM team (currently 4 members), support 500+ customers, and deliver an excellent experience at scale. The strategy and systems are in place — we’re looking for someone to run the function day-to-day, coach the team, and drive retention, renewals, and expansion.

This role is ideal for a Customer Success leader ready to own and scale a growing, complex customer base. Whether you’re managing a small team and looking for your next step or have led a larger org but want to return to a hands-on, execution-focused role, this is a leadership position for someone who takes full ownership of results, loves working directly with customers and teams, and is driven by impact.

**The fine print (but way more exciting):**

* This is a remote role based in the U.S., with a few in-person team meetups each year. Our HQ is in Jersey, UK, and our 80-person team is spread across the U.K. and U.S.
* Our product is deep, flexible, and genuinely complex. At the same time, we serve a wide variety of customers across many different industries and sizes.
* Our average contract values are relatively low given the depth and complexity of our product, which means each CSM manages around 50 accounts with an average book size of $2 million ARR. Driving efficient, high-quality execution at scale is essential.
* Pinpoint isn’t for everyone. We’re still in startup mode. Things move fast, some processes are still evolving, and you’ll need to be proactive, adaptable, and hands-on.
* Our
  **values**
  shape how we work. We’re looking for people who embody these values in everything they do.

**About the Role**

You’ll be responsible for leading our U.S. Customer Success team and ensuring our customers stay successful, satisfied, and engaged. Your impact will be measured by how well you drive customer retention (GRR), revenue growth and account expansion (NRR), product adoption and onboarding effectiveness (Customer time-to-value), team performance and engagement, and overall customer health.

**This is an execution-focused role:**
you’ll drive performance, reinforce playbooks, and hold the team accountable for results. Your day-to-day responsibilities include:

* Managing and coaching a team of 4 Customer Success professionals to achieve implementation, retention, renewal, and upsell goals
* Building the muscle for renewals and upsells—ensuring each team member understands how to spot, shape, and close expansion opportunities
* Overseeing the customer experience for 500+ U.S. accounts, including managing a small book of strategic accounts
* Monitoring customer health and usage metrics to proactively address risks and drive account success
* Serving as an escalation point for high-impact customer issues
* Partnering with RevOps, UK Head of CS, Sales, Product, and Marketing to implement playbooks, share customer insights, and support expansion
* Leading hiring and onboarding efforts as the team grows

**About You**

* Proven track record leading Customer Success teams in B2B SaaS, with experience managing CSMs focused on implementation, adoption, renewals, and expansion.
* Comfortable supporting a technically complex product with diverse customer workflows
* Strong people manager — you lead with empathy, structure, and accountability
* Proven track record of driving retention and expansion with a strong commercial mindset that understands how Customer Success impacts revenue
* Hands-on and high-agency — you’re happy rolling up your sleeves
* Excellent communicator who can influence across functions
* Deep understanding of customer value drivers and post-sale customer journeys
* Experience in a high-growth or startup environment
* Based in the U.S. (EST or CST preferred) with valid work authorization

Our mission is simple: make the best formula in the world. That’s why we studied the latest breast milk science, worked directly with suppliers we know and trust, set uncompromising quality standards, developed our own small batch blending process, built our own manufacturing facilities, and conducted a groundbreaking clinical trial. Our goal is to create a future where all parents feel amazing about feeding their baby—no matter how they do it.

When we launched our Whole Nutrition Infant Formula in March 2022, we were the first new U.S infant formula manufacturer in 15 years. Since then, we’ve been leading the way in a lot of ways.

* The first and only U.S. infant formula company to add the two most abundant proteins found in breast milk—alpha-lac and lactoferrin—to our ingredients list
* The first infant formula company to receive Clean Label Project’s Purity Award (and we test for 700 contaminants vs the required 400)
* We ran the largest clinical trial by a new infant formula brand in 25 years—clinically proving our benefits vs a leading infant formula like:
* Less spit up
* Softer poops
* Easier digestion
* More efficient weight gain
* Enhanced nutrient absorption
* Longer stretches between nighttime feeds\\*

ByHeart has rapidly emerged as a leader in infant nutrition, fortifying the domestic supply chain by owning end-to-end manufacturing in 3 US facilities and ranking in the top 10% of the U.S. infant formula category within just one year. Strategic partnerships with retailers like Walmart and Whole Foods have expanded access to their premium, science-backed formula, now available in over 70% of U.S. stores.

With >$400M in funding, we’re shifting the industry forward—and this is just the beginning. Help us build a future where all parents can feel amazing about feeding, by joining our growing team of >300 people that stretches across the country.

We're proud to offer competitive, family-first benefits, including but not limited to:

1. **Health insurance for the whole family**
   : medical, dental, & vision insurance covered 100%, with 90% coverage for your family.
2. **Flexible paid time off**
   : plus 12+ company holidays, and 2 floating holidays to use at your discretion!
3. **16-weeks of fully-paid parental leave and new parent support**

This position is responsible for enhancing each customer's relationship with First Advantage. Support is primarily delivered by email and occasionally via phone, or at client meetings. Each escalation is unique in that there are no scripts to follow.

This role must be able to work independently and think outside the box to resolve complex inquiries.

* De-escalation & Quality Assurance - Effectively manage and de-escalate customer frustrations with a focus on maintaining professionalism.
