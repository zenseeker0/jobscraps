Please note that failure to follow this instruction may result in your application being disqualified, as it demonstrates an inability to follow directions.**

To ensure full consideration, applications must be submitted by June 30, 2025.

PST adheres to a hands-off approach whenever possible, prioritizing verbal de-escalation and conflict resolution techniques. The only instance where physical intervention is appropriate is if an individual poses an immediate physical threat to themselves, others, or you. Acceptable physical intervention techniques will be taught during our mandatory Phase I training.
