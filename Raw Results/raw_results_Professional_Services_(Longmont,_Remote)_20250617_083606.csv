Charm Industrial is looking for a steady-handed, people-smart **Pyrolyzer Shift Supervisor (Field Operations Shift Supervisor)** to lead our field teams in turning science into serious climate action.

**What’s In It For You:**

* **Competitive pay:** $39–$44/hour depending on experience.
* **Work-life balance:** Enjoy a 4-days on / 4-days off schedule with 12-hour shifts—more time to rest, explore, or just be weird and wonderful.
* **Fully paid health coverage:** We cover 100% of your medical premiums because staying healthy shouldn’t come at a cost.
* **Stock options:** You're not just clocking in—you’re investing in the future of carbon removal.
* **401(k) with matching:** We match 50% of contributions up to 6%—save for the future while you help save the planet (after 1 year of service with no additional vesting periods after that).
* **Paid time off & parental leave:** Recharge with time off and take care of what matters most.
* **Annual professional development stipend:** We pay you to keep learning, because curiosity is part of the job.
* **On-site perks:** Healthy snacks and subsidized lunches—because solving climate change works up an appetite.
* **Big mission, real impact:** Be part of a company literally burying carbon underground—on purpose, and at scale.

**How You Stand Out:**

**Experience & Background:**

* 3-5 years in operations, production, or field-based work—at least 2 in a leadership or team lead role.
* Familiar with manufacturing, equipment-heavy environments, or fast-paced field ops.
* Prior experience in oil & gas, construction, manufacturing, or industrial processing preferred.
* Comfortable managing people, schedules, and shifting priorities.

**Skills & Traits:**

* **You’ve got eyes on everything**—production targets, safety metrics, shift dynamics.
* **You coach in the moment**, delegate with intention, and know when to roll up your sleeves.
* **You take pride** in clean handovers, detailed logs, and holding the team to high standards.
* **You can flex** between proactive strategy and real-time problem solving without breaking stride.
* **You understand the value of structure**—SOPs, safety protocols, checklists—and follow them with purpose.

**Your Role in Action:**

**Lead the Crew:**

Drive shift meetings, coach team members, and keep everyone aligned on expectations. Create growth opportunities for Operators and Shift Leads by mentoring on the floor.

**Own the Plan:**

Execute the daily production schedule and make adjustments as needed. Coordinate across shifts to keep the flow moving smoothly and avoid bottlenecks.

**Keep It Safe & Sharp:**

Lead safety audits, enforce standards, and model safe practices in every task. Spot trends in training gaps, maintenance needs, or near-misses and take action fast.

**Balance the Details:**

Manage scheduling, timecards, and training compliance for your crew. Ensure clear communication during shift handovers and log everything like a pro.

**Why Charm:**

At Charm Industrial, we’re not just talking about reducing wildfires, improving agricultural soil, health and fighting climate change—we’re actually doing it. Our technology converts excess biomass into carbon-rich bio-oil and injects it underground for permanent carbon removal. It’s bold. It’s scalable. And it’s working.

We’ve already removed thousands of tons of CO₂, and we’re just getting started! Our customers include names like Microsoft, Shopify, and Stripe, and our team includes creative, gritty people who thrive on innovation, ownership, and mission. We take our mission seriously, but not ourselves—expect weird biomass moments, silly machine names, and a lot of joy in doing hard things together.

**Excited to work with purpose, learn as you go, and help pioneer something the world has never seen before? We want you on our team!**

If you're ready to lead a team that runs on purpose and isn't afraid to get their hands dirty in the name of climate progress—A**PPLY NOW** and lead the shift toward something better.","","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Charm-Industrial","","","","","","","","","","","","","2025-06-17 08:36:04.403006","Professional Services (Longmont, Remote)"

Jax Fish House has been setting the standard for sustainable seafood and warm, unforgettable hospitality in landlocked Colorado for over **30 years**. Our **flagship Boulder location** is not just a restaurant — it’s an institution. A cozy, high-energy, 75-seat seafood bar with a cult following, generations of regulars, and a reputation that spans decades.

Now, we’re searching for an exceptional **General Manager** to lead this iconic location into its next chapter.

* **Guest-Obsessed**: Passion for warm, authentic, and elevated hospitality that feels both refined and familiar.
* **Culture Keeper**: Protect and evolve a legacy brand, uphold traditions, and bring fresh energy to a deeply rooted local institution.
* **Business-Savvy**: Financial acumen, scheduling, ordering, inventory, labor, and P&L experience required. You know your numbers — and how to act on them.
* **Community-Oriented**: Jax is a community hub. We give back and get involved — and you should too.

  
**WHAT YOU’LL DO:**  

* Oversee all front-of-house operations and ensure an outstanding guest experience, night after night.
* Build and maintain a culture of excellence, integrity, and hospitality.
* Lead with empathy, accountability, and a relentless drive to improve.
* Collaborate closely with the Executive Chef to align culinary and service standards.
* Recruit, train, and develop a top-tier FOH team.
* Manage financials, scheduling, and inventory with precision.
Represent Jax in the community and continue our proud tradition of service beyond our four walls.

Join a company with 30+ years of excellence and an unwavering commitment to sustainability, quality, and people.

* Medical, dental, and vision insurance.
* 401(k) with company match.
