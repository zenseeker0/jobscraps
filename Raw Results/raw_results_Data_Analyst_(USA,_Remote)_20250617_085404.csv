Aspire teammates work either remotely or on a hybrid schedule from offices in Scottsdale, Cincinnati, and Richmond. If you are looking for a company that offers room for advancement, great benefits, and positive vibes, then Aspire may be the place for you!

Our brands—including Sur La Table, One Kings Lane, and Backcountry—rely on fast, intelligent decision-making rooted in high-integrity data. We're hiring an **AI-First Data Analyst** who combines deep statistical know-how with modern AI tooling and automation instincts.

This is a highly technical, hands-on role. You’ll build causal models, apply advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., Double ML), and develop internal data tools that help our brands operate faster, smarter, and more autonomously. You’ll be embedded with senior operators and report directly to a brand CEO or platform leader, supporting real decisions—not dashboards for dashboards’ sake.

This role is designed for someone early in their career, but exceptionally gifted, ambitious, and AI-native. You’ll grow fast, learn directl

### **What you get to do every day:**

* Conduct causal analysis and treatment effect estimation using Double ML, causal forests, and uplift modeling to guide high-stakes decisions (e.g., promotions, marketing strategy, inventory management).
* Build AI-powered internal tools that automate analytical tasks and surface insights (e.g., GPT-powered report generation, automated anomaly detection).
* Develop and own dashboards and data pipelines that drive real-time visibility across sales, marketing, operations, and finance.
* Partner directly with business leaders to translate fuzzy questions into testable hypotheses, and then deliver answers that inform action.
* Identify opportunities to automate recurring analyses via custom GPTs, scripts, or workflow platforms like n8n.
* Work closely with engineering and data platform teams to improve data cleanliness, accessibility, and documentation.

### **What you bring to the role:**

* 1–3 years of experience in data science, quantitative analysis, or machine learning.
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Statistics, Economics, Computer Science, Data Science, or a related quantitative field.
* Expertise in causal inference frameworks—especially Double ML, A/B testing, and other counterfactual methods.
* Strong coding skills in Python or R; experience with SQL, Jupyter, and version control (Git).
* Comfortable building data pipelines and working with large datasets.
* Proficiency with AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, or custom GPTs, and a drive to integrate them into your work.
* Curious, fast-learning, and deeply motivated to solve business problems through analysis and automation—not just reporting.
* Experience with workflow automation (e.g., n8n, Make, Zapier) is a plus.

### **Why this role is different**

* Most data roles live downstream of decisions. This one lives at the center of them.
* As our AI-First Data Analyst, you won’t just be running models—you’ll be shaping how our business thinks. You’ll work directly with executives, build tooling used by dozens of team members, and automate away repetitive insight work so you can focus on strategic problems.
* We aren’t looking for someone to maintaindashboards. We’re looking for someone to build the next generation of internal data products—and use AI to do it 10x faster.

### **What’s in it for you?**

* **Joining CSC Generation isn’tjust about having a seat at the table—it’s about helping redesign the table entirely. You’ll be challenged, stretched, and supported as you grow faster than you thought possible. In addition to competitive compensation, we offer:**
* **Executive Access:** Work directly with brand CEOs and senior leadership, solving real business problems and earning mentorship from top operators.
* **AI-First Skill Building:**Get hands-on with the most advanced AI tools in the market. From automation to prompt engineering, you’ll build a modern tech stack that sets you apart in any industry.
* **Accelerated Career Path:**High performers are quickly entrusted with greater responsibility, new challenges, and leadership opportunities across our portfolio of brands.
* **Competitive benefits:**Paid time off policies, 401(k)/RRSP match, medical/dental/vision and a variety of supplemental policies, and employee discounts at our portfolio companies

### **What our interview process looks like:**

* \\uD83D\\uDCDE **Step 1:** If you align with our vision and meet the qualifications, we’ll reach out to schedule a conversation and introduce CSC.
* \\uD83E\\uDDE0 **Step 2:**You’ll complete a short AI or product-building challenge so we can understand how you approach problems and execution.
* \\uD83D\\uDCAC **Step 3:**Participate in deep-dive interviews with CSC leadership focused on your experience, product mindset, and operational thinking.

Over the next 10 years, payment and financial services businesses will upgrade the movement of money and financial assets to blockchain-based networks.

  
  

We are on a mission to revolutionize the way people access and transact in the world’s most widely recognized and stable currency, the US Dollar. We believe that financial inclusion should be a right, not a privilege, and that cost-effective, accessible financial services can make a profound impact on people’s lives, especially in regions where traditional banking systems fall short.

  
  

We are building a next-generation payments, asset management, and operations platform that’s purpose-built for the transmission of value on blockchain digital rails. The Company is led by Nick van Eck (prev. at General Catalyst 4+ years) and Drake Evans (ex-lead engineer at Frax Finance, the issuer of the second largest onchain stablecoin).

Our first product &mdash; a fully collateralized, freely tradeable USD stablecoin &mdash; will be launched in the year ahead. It’ll be competing directly with the heavyweight stables in the market today but will differentiate materially in terms of its value proposition, resource allocation, and GTM model.
