Mission Statement

Continuing the lifelong work of Billy Graham, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association exists to support and extend the evangelistic calling and ministry of Franklin Graham by proclaiming the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to all we can by every effective means available to us and by equipping the church and others to do the same.

Statement of Faith

These core beliefs make up the foundation upon which all our ministry endeavors are based.

* We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God revealing the love of God to the world. (1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17; John 3:16).
* We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  
  (Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; Ephesians 4:4-6).
* We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood on the cross, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. (Matthew 1:23; John 1:1-4 and 1:29; Acts 1:11 and 2:22-24; Romans 8:34; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 1:1-4 and 4:15).
* We believe that all men everywhere are lost and face the judgment of God, that Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation, and that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ results in regeneration by the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, we believe that God will reward the righteous with eternal life in heaven, and that He will banish the unrighteous to everlasting punishment in hell. (Luke 24:46-47; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:23; 2 Corinthians 5:10-11; Ephesians 1:7 and 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7).
* We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, whose indwelling enables the Christian to live a godly life. (John 3:5-8; Acts 1:8 and 4:31; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Galatians 5:16-18; Ephesians 6:12; Colossians 2:6-10).
* We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved unto the resurrection of eternal life and the lost unto the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment. (1 Corinthians 15:51-57; Revelation 20:11-15).
* We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the church. (1 Corinthians 12:12, 27; Ephesians 1:22-23).
* We believe that the ministry of evangelism (sharing and proclaiming the message of salvation only possible by grace through faith in Jesus Christ) and discipleship (helping followers of Christ grow up into maturity in Christ) is a responsibility of all followers of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15;1 Peter 3:15).
* We believe God’s plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as unique biological persons made for each other. God instituted monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female. (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5-6; Mark 10:6-9; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9).
* We believe that we must dedicate ourselves to prayer, to the service of our Lord, to His authority over our lives, and to the ministry of evangelism. (Matthew 9:35-38; 22:37-39, and 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:9-15 and 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10; Colossians 2:6-10; 1 Peter 3:15).
* We believe that human life is sacred from conception to its natural end; and that we must have concern for the physical and spiritual needs of our fellowmen. (Psalm 139:13; Isaiah 49:1; Jeremiah 1:5; Matthew 22:37-39; Romans 12:20-21; Galatians 6:10).
* We believe God wonderfully and immutably creates each person a biological male or female. These two distinct, but complementary sexes together reflect the image and likeness of God. Rejection of one’s biological sex is a rejection of God’s merciful design and creative order. (Genesis 1:26-27; Mark 10:6; 1 Corinthians 6:9; Deuteronomy 22:5).

Expectations for Ministry Employment

As an employee of Billy Graham Evangelistic Association:

* I acknowledge that the Lord Jesus Christ is my personal Savior and that I am a personal representative of Him.
* I understand that BGEA is a Christian organization whose purpose is proclaiming the message of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ throughout the world.
* I agree that the purpose of my employment with BGEA is to further its Christian purpose, that I am prepared to assist in accomplishing that purpose, and that my role with BGEA plays a vital part in carrying out its Christian purpose and mission.
* I understand that I must exhibit conduct that is consistent with BGEA’s expectations, whether at work or away from work, in keeping with scriptural teachings and principles as set forth in God’s Word, BGEA’s Statement of Faith, and BGEA’s policies including Christian Conduct.
* I understand that BGEA has the right and the responsibility to ensure that its Christian religious purpose is carried on with the highest standards and is not harmed or impeded by conduct that is inconsistent with the Bible, BGEA’s Statement of Faith, its Christian religious purpose, or its policies
* I understand that any of my conduct which is not in keeping with the scriptural teachings and principles as set forth in God’s Word, BGEA’s Statement of Faith, and BGEA’s policies, is inconsistent with BGEA’s Christian religious purpose.
* I understand that if my conduct is determined by BGEA to be inconsistent with its Christian religious purpose, the result will be corrective action up to and including termination from employment.

The Title VII Exception for Employment

The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) is a faith-based religious organization committed to spreading the Good News of Jesus Christ through every effective means. Consistent with our charitable purpose to share the Christian faith, a requirement for employment at BGEA is affirmation and adherence to our Christian Statement of Faith. Our Statement of Faith prerequisite for employment is based upon federal law set forth in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-1.

Job Description:

The

Oregon Department of Justice

(DOJ)

Division of Child Support

is seeking motivated, analytical, and equity-minded candidates for the position of Strategic Initiatives Coordinator (Operations & Policy Analyst 3). This role has been developed to help drive organizational transformation throughout the Oregon Child Support Program and its strategic plan. The Oregon Child Support Program, administered by the Division of Child Support, is part of the federal child support program, which is one of the top four anti-poverty programs in the nation. The mission of the Oregon Child Support Program is supporting parents to support children, and the program is an important part of Oregon’s human services system. To achieve its mission, the DOJ Division of Child Support comprises four large sections: Business Services, Technical Services, Field Services, and the Director’s Office.

As a key member in execution of the Oregon Child Support Program strategic plan, this position will work directly with the Chief Transformation Officer. The coordinator will play a pivotal role in implementing change initiatives across the program, with particular focus on project execution, data-informed decision making, and cross-functional collaboration. This role is ideal for someone who thrives in operationalizing vision into action, and who is deeply committed to public service, organizational improvement, and advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion.

If this is you, we want to hear from you!

The Strategic Initiatives Coordinator assists in defining and developing the approach for guiding individuals, teams, and the program to align with the program’s strategic plan. The Coordinator will advise and support the Executive Team in building and maintaining a healthy coalition of managers throughout the program who drive change in their part of the organization. This role will prepare managers and supervisors in understanding their role as coaches, adapt to the changes themselves, and develop change management competencies.

It is critical for this role to provide program leadership with meaningful support in developing and executing strategic initiatives across the division’s program areas. Areas of particular emphasis are strategic planning and diversity, equity, and inclusion. This position provides operational and policy support ensuring compliance, efficiency, and driving system improvements to remove systemic barriers, foster inclusiveness, and create meaningful change for parents, especially for underrepresented communities.
