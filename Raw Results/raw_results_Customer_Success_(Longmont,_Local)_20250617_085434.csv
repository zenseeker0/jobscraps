* Develop bring-up plans and design verification plans for new hardware and systems.
* Perform bring-up and key verification testing of modules and small integrated systems, often working with a technician to complete validation.
* Release modules and assemblies to production, working with the Manufacturing and Test Engineering teams.
* Mentor junior and senior engineers to build technical understanding and professional development.
* Use working knowledge of adjacent fields, such as software and mechanical, to streamline development of electronics modules and systems.

* Minimum of 6 years of relevant experience in board-level electronics design, analysis, and test.
* Significant experience designing electronics with rigor, in teams that value thorough analysis and testing. Aerospace design experience preferred but not required.
* Expertise in aspects of digital and mixed-signal electronics, such as signal integrity, implementing FPGAs on boards, ADCs/DACs, and telemetry subsystems. Experience with high-speed digital (e.g. 10+ Gbps SerDes) and SDR applications are preferred but not required.
* Experience owning the design phase of complex board-level electronics, including trade studies, key part selection, and detailed design.
* Experience delivering hardware designs through production and deployment.
* Expertise in PCB layout, including high-density interconnect (HDI) stackup design and high-speed routing.
* Experience running board-level signal integrity and/or power integrity simulation tools such as Ansys SIwave, ADS SIPro, or Mentor Hyperlynx.
* Proven success in debugging, root cause analysis, and design reviews.
* Strong working knowledge of adjacent fields, such as software and mechanical, that guides hardware design and system design.
