**Overview**

SPANX isn’t your average company. We revolutionized an industry by challenging the status quo and putting the customer *first*. You might know the story: our founder, Sara Blakely, who needed the right thing as a base layer to feel 100% in white pants, so she cut the legs off a pair of tights and Spanx was born. The spark of that origin is the fuel for our future. We grew up in shapewear. But we’ve graduated. For 25 years (yep, we're old enough to rent a car now), we've been experimenting, innovating, and occasionally banging our heads against the drawing board. And we will never stop obsessing about what women who are out there doing their thing deserve. Because we are those women. And we’re honored to create on behalf of us all.

We make elevated essentials with confidence built in. Essentials for layering underneath or wearing out loud, for “just-between-us” and “where'd you get that?” For everything you've got planned (and don't). Because what you put on can change how you show up. And if its' not working for you, it's got no place in your closet. Or on your body. Creating items that’ll make you feel great is a matter of the heart—and the lab. In every Spanx product is technology we design and build to highlight, complement, and form your look, just the way you like it. SPANX design and technology help make sure what you see in the mirror reflects that feeling of feeling your best (you know the feeling?). We are a high-growth, innovative and ambitious company and we are embarking on an exciting trajectory of both digital and international expansion.

Gladly, the customer-centered AI customer support platform is built around people, not tickets.

Companies like Allbirds, Bombas, Crate & Barrel, and Warby Parker use Gladly to create exceptional customer experiences, transforming everyday customer interactions into lasting connections.

* Have a strong understanding of B2B SaaS revenue workflows and can identify high-leverage points for AI intervention

Our CFO organization is embarking on a transformative vision: To be known as trusted business partners to the company and stewards of long-term value creation for our policyowners by driving influence and impact through high-quality, timely insights.

Corporate Strategy contributes to this vision by identifying and analyzing emerging industry trends and competitive risks, recommending growth opportunities and ensuring business and corporate unit strategies align with the organizational vision and long-term aspirations. Corporate Strategy will also evolve its capabilities and develop a multi-year strategic planning framework, incorporating scenario-based planning.

Corporate Strategy accomplishes these goals by working with senior leaders to optimize our portfolio of businesses for the benefit of our participating policyholders. Corporate Strategy’s remit includes strategic planning, Board strategy, and internal consultancy all of which involves finding answers to top-of-mind business problems for senior leaders, including the CEO, Board of Directors, and Executive Leadership Team.

As a leader on the Corporate Strategy team, your efforts will focus on:

  

* Defining MassMutual’s strategy, including what metrics we use to measure success and optimizing our portfolio of businesses for long-term health and value
* Developing and collaborating with partners across the enterprise on Board strategy deliverables including macro analysis of the external and competitive environment
* Helping build out a robust strategic planning process tied to a refreshed annual planning process; including creating scenarios to pressure test strategic pathways
* Producing actionable business insights through in-depth knowledge of our existing businesses aligned with peer Consumer Insights and Market Insights organizations
* Scoping, designing and leading bespoke projects for senior leaders that solve key enterprise priorities
* Recruiting and developing iMMerse analysts with an emphasis on teaching them the strategy process and problem solving ((e.g., providing active coaching/feedback, serving as a developmental manager or mentor, leading part of our recruiting and training efforts).

MassMutual’s Corporate Strategy team adheres to a “classic” strategy process. We help the CEO, Board, and Executive Team on enterprise-level strategy and work with our CFO colleagues on building out a multi-year strategic planning process. We also serve as an “internal consultancy” where we help solve the most difficult business problems (typically cross-functional) facing our leaders.

The Corporate Strategy team is composed of high-performing professionals with a mix of top-tier financial services and management consulting experience. The Corporate Strategy team consists of the Strategy, Consumer Insights, and Market Insights functions. This role sits within the Strategy team, reports to the Head of Strategy, and works closely with the Head of Corporate Strategy. The team is aligned with MassMutual’s core values: focus on the customer, act with integrity, value people, work collaboratively, achieve results.

Characteristics of successful Strategy Leads include insatiable intellectual curiosity, courageous thought leadership, team leadership, relentless process and project management, and superior communication skills. The team is acutely aware that we are not professional problem solvers; we are professional communicators who solve problems to have our solutions adopted and drive value. Because we are reliant on peers across the organization for data and analysis, we approach each project humbly and as an opportunity to learn and collaborate knowing that we often co-present with our partners to senior leadership to diffuse the strategy process throughout the enterprise.

Cultivating, coaching, and mentoring of our Analysts is incredibly important. In turn, our Analysts provide our Strategy Leads with the leverage they need to grow and take on more responsibility. In addition, Strategy Leads take on leadership roles in the recruitment, training, and ongoing development of Analysts.

Strategy Leads will have compelling opportunities for significant professional advancement within the Corporate Strategy team and MassMutual more broadly.

Benchmark International is now looking for business professionals to fill roles on its sell-side mergers and acquisitions teams.

Our analysts begin learning negotiation skills, valuation metrics, and the entire M&A process from their first day on the job. They engage clients and potential acquirers on a daily basis; generating buyer interest in our clients, negotiating the terms of non-disclosure agreements, and initiating the response to the buyer’s due diligence investigation into their team’s portfolio of businesses for sale.

This is a role requiring the ability to hold your own against business owners, private equity associates, and business development professionals from Fortune 500 companies. You will work on multiple files, across a variety of industries, every day. As an entry-level position, you will not be expected to have any particular M&A knowledge but must have a keen interest in growing your knowledge-base in this exciting field of business. All aspects of the company sale process will unfold on the trading floor within easy earshot of your workstation. As you gain experience, your involvement and responsibilities will progress further through the process. As there is more than enough work to go around on our teams, those with the interest and ability will be given additional responsibilities on a case-by-case basis after first proving their ability to go toe-to-toe with the various constituencies involved in the process and come out with favorable results for our clients.

Our deal teams have been closing between one and two transactions per month over the last several years. They rely on their analysts to continually restock the pool of interested buyers in order to continue that success.

Client origination, general firm marketing, and similar operational distractions are taken off the teams’ plates, keeping to Benchmark International’s model. This allows a more focused approach on operations and portfolio management. The teams’ obligations regarding each client commence with a signed engagement letter and detailed file, prepared by the separate Deal Origination Department, and continue through every aspect of the transaction (other than legal and accounting services) to the closing and collection of the resulting success fee.

**Job Responsibilities**

Analysts will work together in pairs, under the direct supervision of an associate serving in the role of Senior Deal Associate. The role of the Senior Deal Associate serves as the next logical step in the analyst’s advancement and they will thus have clear visibility into future potential career opportunities.
  
  
Your specific duties as an analyst will include:

  

* Developing and building relationships with Benchmark International’s clients (business owners pursuing the sale of their business) and pool of potential acquirers for those businesses. This is a front-line role involving frequent communication with seller-clients and buyers, primarily via phone and email.
* Managing early stages of each acquirer-seller relationship from introduction to preliminary negotiations including (i) performing research to uncover potential companies and individuals interested in acquiring businesses owned by Benchmark’s clients, (ii) reaching out to potential acquirers via phone and email, (iii) managing client’s profiles on third party and proprietary online portals and responding to inquiries on such portals, (iv) negotiating nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) with potential acquirers, (v) preparing executed NDAs and acquirer profiles for clients, (vi) obtaining clients’ approval of NDA’s and potential acquirers’ access to client’s marketing materials which contain sensitive business data, (vii) fielding approved potential acquirers’ additional questions about clients, replying where possible and seeking additional data from clients where required, (vii) arranging meetings and conference calls between clients and acquirers, occasionally moderating such calls, (vii) following up on conference calls and on site visits, and (viii) driving approved potential acquirers to submit offers for clients’ businesses.
* Developing relationships with private equity funds, venture capital funds, family offices, and active trade buyers.
* Assisting associates in preparation and revision of clients’ marketing materials, primarily through requesting additional information from clients and assembling lists of potential acquirers.
* Filing and keeping Benchmark International’s networked customer resource management system up-to-date for all of the above.
* Communicating effectively with clients by phone and electronic means to obtain client information and convey results of analysis.
* Researching industries and M&A market segments.
* Preparing reports of findings, illustrating data graphically, and translating complex findings into written text.

**Job Requirements**

As an analyst, you must be a highly energetic and passionate individual with a positive and highly motivated can-do attitude. You must have the strong desire and ambition to succeed in this rewarding industry. It is also vital for your role as an analyst that you possess excellent verbal and written communication, analytical, mathematical, and interpersonal skills, as well as presentation abilities.

Our analysts deal only with existing clients. As a client-facing role, each analyst must be able to convey bad news and deal with clients' unique sensitivities while keeping each client moving through the company sales process at a steady pace.

Specific qualifications for the Deal Analyst include:

  

* Experienced in professional business writing.
* Prioritization and organization skills.
* Proficiency in Word, Outlook, and Excel.
* Communication skills: written and verbal; delivering information in an empathetic, yet persuasive manner.
* Proficiency with online research including proprietary sources such as Hoovers, IBISWorld, DealNexus, PrivCo, Corpfin, Pitchbook, OneSource, and First Research.
* Commercial understanding and awareness of business.
* Possession of a valid and current driver license.
* Associate degree (A.A.) or higher preferred, one-year related experience and/or training; or equivalent combination of education and experience.
* Ability to consistently present yourself in a professional manner in keeping with Benchmark International's image (as shown, for example, on the company's web site).
* Availability and willingness to work outside normal business hours at times, whether early or late, as required by client schedules and expectations.
* Availability and willingness to travel for occasional overnight trips on short notice (rarely, if ever, longer than two days).
* Ability to obtain a Tennessee real-estate sales associate license within 90 days of employment (For employment in our Tennessee office).
* Have no unfavorable history with FINRA, the SEC, or any state regulatory agency.
* Must be able to work in the office each and every day as this is not a remote or hybrid position.
Professional dress attire is required.  

**Salary**

Analysts receive a bi-weekly salary in the range of $42,500 to $52,500 and commissions equal to a percentage of revenue obtained from closing transactions with an additional end-of-year bonus if the team's target is achieved. As a result, overall compensation can vary from year to year based on success and on target performance could result in total compensation in the range of $51,500 - $78,375.

All Benchmark International positions offer paid time off, standard holidays, and community service days. Employees are eligible for highly competitive company-subsidized medical, dental, vision, and AD&D insurance; 401k with company matching; flexible spending accounts; and flexible dependent care assistance accounts.

(We don’t currently operate in all 50 states, but we’d love to chat.) You will be expected to travel to Indianapolis for orientation and training your first week, and also at least two times per year for all team events.

You’ll lead the development and execution of technical, off-page, and on-page SEO strategies that align with each client’s business objectives and competitive landscape. Your work will go beyond ticking checkboxes—you’ll deliver impact.

Success in this role means launching insightful ThinkFirst strategies, executing high-leverage 90-day SEO plans, and ensuring continuous improvements in rankings, traffic, and goal completions from organic search.

**Why is this role important for Valve+Meter’s work?**

Valve+Meter’s mission is built on results, not fluff. Our clients expect a measurable return on their marketing investments. That means using data, research, and executional excellence to turn search demand into business opportunity—at scale.

This role plays a key part in delivering that performance. You’ll collaborate with internal teams—content, development, paid media, design, analytics—and directly shape the SEO direction for each account. You’ll also contribute to the advancement of our SEO playbooks, tools, and frameworks.

* **Own site-wide organic visibility.** Focus on improving rankings for high-value, non-branded queries, increasing qualified sessions, and growing conversion rates from organic traffic.
* **Lead content strategy and optimization.** Collaborate with content strategists and writers to plan, produce, and optimize content around core themes, service offerings, and customer pain points. This includes blogs, landing pages, and strategic pillar/sub-pillar structures.
* **Conduct technical SEO audits and partner on implementation.** Identify and help resolve indexation issues, crawl problems, site architecture flaws, schema gaps, and other technical blockers.
* **Drive link acquisition strategy.** Develop off-page strategies through guest posts, digital PR, niche edits, and authority-building collaborations that support ranking goals.
* **Monitor performance and translate data into decisions.** Use tools like GA4, GSC, SEMrush, and Looker Studio to identify insights, measure campaign impact, and influence ongoing strategy.
* **Communicate strategy and results.** Equip client-facing teams with reporting and messaging to explain what we’re doing, why it matters, and how it’s impacting business goals.
* **Work cross-functionally.** Align SEO efforts with paid media, dev, analytics, and brand strategies—ensuring cohesive digital campaigns and resource-efficient execution.
* **Stay ahead of the curve.** Monitor algorithm changes, industry shifts, and SERP trends. Test and share new techniques that improve performance.

For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows: .75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota; 1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%; 1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.","","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Splunk","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/f60ba85136045405c5297c160022bc2d","https://www.splunk.com","","Decline to state","Decline to state","Splunk helps make organizations more digitally resilient.

At OLIPOP, we’re on a mission to positively impact consumer health at scale. And we’re doing it through something simple: soda. But not just any soda, a new kind of soda: one that’s delicious, refreshing, and actually good for you.
  
  
This mission is deeply personal for our CEO, Co-Founder, and Formulator, Ben Goodwin. Like many of us, Ben grew up consuming the Standard American Diet: lots of soda and processed foods that prioritized convenience over nutrition. But at 14, he took his health into his own hands. After making significant changes to his nutrition and exercise, he lost 50 pounds and saw a transformation in his energy, mood, and emotional clarity.
  
  
Those changes sparked a deep curiosity about the connection between nutrition and health. Ben became a relentless student of the gut microbiome and the ways it supports overall wellness. The more he discovered, the more passionate he became about finding credible, science-backed ways to make consumer health accessible to everyone.
  
  
The mission was clear. The vehicle? Less so. After exploring the possibilities, Ben landed on an unexpected yet familiar choice: soda. It was something he loved as a kid, and he knew millions shared that same nostalgia. But this wouldn’t be just any soda. With most Americans falling short on daily fiber, Ben set out to create a version with more fiber and less sugar, one that was perfectly balanced. The result? A deliciously refreshing soda with 6 to 9 grams of fiber and 2 to 5 grams of sugar, delivering science-backed benefits without sacrificing the classic taste people crave.
  
  
In 2018, the first OLIPOP cans hit the shelves, bringing Ben’s vision to life with a functional soda that anyone could enjoy. And by reimagining soda, we’re also reshaping culture. That means creating products that support health for all and building a business grounded in humanistic values: empathy, integrity, and a belief in better for everyone. From the ingredients we source to the culture we foster, we’re committed to proving that business (and beverage!) can be a force for good, and that soda has the power to bring people together.
  
  
So join us, and let’s write a new American soda story together. One we can all feel good about. One OLIPOP at a time.
  
  
We’re looking for a Consumer Insights Manager to uncover and elevate the voice of our customer to drive smarter, human-centered decisions across brand, product, and innovation. As part of an innovative, category-disrupting brand, this role goes beyond traditional research—it's about shaping the future of how we connect with consumers in a rapidly evolving marketplace.
  
  
You’re equal parts strategic thinker, empathetic listener, and curious storyteller—someone who thrives on turning complex data into clear, compelling narratives. You’ll partner cross-functionally to translate insights into action, influencing how we show up in the world and ensuring that consumer perspective is at the heart of everything we do.
  
  
You’ll lead key research initiatives, design learning agendas, and connect the dots between consumer behavior, cultural shifts, and category trends. Whether it’s testing creative, shaping a go-to-market plan, or guiding the launch of a new innovation, you’ll help the organization ask sharper questions and make bolder, better-informed decisions.
  
  
**Responsibilities**

* Foster a data-informed culture within the marketing team and broader org by regularly sharing consumer learnings and guiding teams toward insight-led decisions.
* Collaborate cross-functionally with internal teams and external agency partners to embed the consumer voice into briefs, creative reviews, strategy, and campaign development.
* Support the execution of end-to-end research initiatives that inform marketing and innovation strategies—including concept testing, creative testing, brand health tracking, and audience segmentation.
* Manage relationships with external research partners, overseeing day-to-day project execution from research design through analysis and reporting, ensuring findings are translated into clear, actionable insights.
* Contribute to internal reporting and storytelling, helping build presentations and dashboards that track key brand KPIs such as household penetration, brand awareness, and campaign performance.
* Monitor cultural trends and evolving consumer behaviors, bringing forward fresh perspectives and provocative insights that can shape brand strategy, content development, and innovation roadmaps.

**Requirements**

* 6+ years of experience in consumer insights, market research, or related roles (CPG experience preferred; beverage a plus).
* Experience leading both qualitative and quantitative research methods - such as focus groups, ethnographys, tracking studies, segmentation, etc. - and an interest in exploring new approaches.
* Experience writing and designing surveys for DIY tools (like Toluna, Zappi or Numerator), and analyzing raw data.
* Deep intellectual curiosity and a natural instinct to ask “why” behind behaviors, trends, and performance patterns.
* Demonstrated ability to synthesize disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable insights—not just reporting what happened, but uncovering why it matters.
* Strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, with the ability to frame business questions, select appropriate methodologies, and evaluate findings with nuance.
* A keen sense of observation and the ability to identify emerging cultural, category, and consumer shifts before they hit the mainstream.
* Proactive insight-seeker who isn’t afraid to challenge assumptions or bring forward unconventional thinking to spark new ideas.
* Comfortable navigating ambiguity, with the confidence to guide stakeholders when the data doesn’t offer a black-and-white answer.
* Strong organizational and project management skills—able to juggle multiple projects with attention to detail.
* Clear and effective communication skills, both written and verbal, with the ability to distill data into easy-to-understand stories.
* Working knowledge or experience with marketing mix modelling and brand health tracking tools.
* Working knowledge of syndicated tools like Nielsen, SPINS, or Numerator preferred.

**REPORTS TO**

**COMPENSATION:**
$125,000-$140,000 Base Salary + Bonus
  
  
**How We Work**
We may be fully remote, but we’re anything but disconnected. OLIPOP has grown from a few passionate people around a table to a nationwide team, and we’ve done it without losing our collaborative spirit or sense of purpose.
  
  
Connection here is intentional. From cross-functional projects and IRL offsites to thoughtful Slack threads and spontaneous gifs, we make the effort to stay close, even across time zones. Sure, we move quickly, but we lead with trust, transparency, and a shared commitment to doing work that matters.
  
  
We value thoughtful debate. We give feedback with care and receive it with curiosity, knowing that real growth, both personal and collective, comes from listening as much as leading. Because at OLIPOP, it’s not just about getting things done. It’s about growing together, staying true to what matters, and building something with lasting impact.
  
  
**What We Value**
At OLIPOP, our values aren’t just posters on a wall. They shape how we show up: for each other, for our customers, and for the mission we’re chasing together.
  
  

* Mission Connectivity: Everything we do ladders up to our shared goal: supporting human health. Whether launching a new flavor or conducting clinical research, the mission stays front and center.
* Indomitable Spirit: When things get messy, we get inventive. We stay curious, adapt quickly, and find the path forward, most likely with a dedicated Slack thread and a beautifully overbuilt deck.
* Lead at Every Level: Leadership isn’t about titles, it’s about ownership. We speak up, follow through, and lift each other up. If you’ve got ideas and initiative, you’ve got influence.
* Courageous Humility: We’re confident in what we bring and curious about what we don’t know (yet). We give feedback with care, take it with grace, and know that real growth takes both.

**What We’re Looking For**
Success at OLIPOP doesn’t come from checking boxes; it comes from living our values, staying curious, and finding energy in both the pace and the purpose. We’re building something big, and we’re looking for people who:
  
  

* Think big, move fast, and take thoughtful risks
* Thrive in a high-performance, feedback-rich environment
* Value real human connection and honest collaboration
* Are fired up by building something new, and making it better every day

Startup life at OLIPOP is equally fun and fast-paced. If you’re energized by a dynamic environment, eager to grow, and excited to help shape something meaningful from the inside out, OLIPOP is a one-of-a-kind ride.
