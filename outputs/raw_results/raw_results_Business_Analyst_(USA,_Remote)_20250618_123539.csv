**About CyberArk**:  
CyberArk (NASDAQ: CYBR), is the global leader in Identity Security.

The world’s leading organizations trust CyberArk to help secure their most critical assets. To learn more about CyberArk, visit our CyberArk blogs or follow us on X, LinkedIn or Facebook.

 **Job Description**

CyberArk is seeking a Senior Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst with a passion for sales strategy and business insight to join our Business Analytics team. In this role, you will act as a strategic partner to Sales and Sales Operations leaders around the globe—translating data into compelling narratives that drive better, faster decisions. You’ll play a key role in shaping how performance is measured, understood, and improved across our global go-to-market (GTM) organization. While you’ll contribute to dashboard development and scalable reporting in Tableau, this role goes far beyond building reports—you’ll be expected to uncover trends, connect dots across complex datasets, and communicate insights in a way that resonates with non-technical audiences. The ideal candidate is a business-minded analyst with strong sales acumen, excellent communication skills, and an instinct for asking the right questions to get to the heart of the problem.

**Responsibilities:**

* Serve as an embedded analytics partner to global Sales and Sales Operations stakeholders, proactively identifying opportunities to improve pipeline, productivity, and conversion
* Craft clear, executive-ready narratives based on deep-dive analyses of sales performance, pipeline coverage, segmentation, and revenue trends
* Translate complex data and technical concepts into actionable recommendations that are easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand and act upon
* Design and evolve self-service dashboards and tools in Tableau that reduce friction and enable faster time-to-decision
* Maintain a high bar for data accuracy and consistency across reports and ad hoc deliverables
* Collaborate cross-functionally with Sales, RevOps, Marketing, Finance, and IT to align on business definitions and ensure reliable analytics infrastructure
* Help drive a data-driven culture by enabling stakeholders to interpret KPIs and use insights effectively

#LI-Hybrid

 **Qualifications**  

* 4–6 years of experience in Sales Analytics, Sales Operations, Business Intelligence, or a related field
* Proven ability to extract and communicate insights from complex data—especially in a Sales or GTM environment
* Strong business judgment, with experience working directly with senior stakeholders and cross-functional teams
* Working knowledge of SQL and experience with Tableau or a similar BI platform (depth of tool expertise less important than the ability to learn quickly)
* Understanding of B2B sales metrics, pipeline stages, and CRM data (Salesforce experience a plus)
* Excellent storytelling skills—both written and verbal—with the ability to tailor messages to executive and frontline audiences
* Self-starter who thrives in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and isn’t afraid to ask questions or challenge assumptions
* Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative or business-related field
* Smart, bold but humble attitude to work collaboratively with CyberArk colleagues

You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**Operational Excellence**

* Engage directly with engineering and vendor technical teams to validate API schemas, file formats, sequencing, and implementation feasibility.
* Act as the primary technical liaison during integration efforts, troubleshooting complex issues and escalating risks proactively.

**Qualifications:**

* 7+ years of progressive experience as a Business Analyst, with at least 3 years in technical BA roles supporting APIs, integrations, or platform engineering teams.

**Important Notice:**

At Integra Connect, we are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our job applicants. Unfortunately, scammers may attempt to impersonate our company to deceive individuals seeking employment. We take this matter seriously and want to ensure your job search with us is free from any fraudulent activity.

Integra Connect has become aware of recent, fraudulent recruitment activity being conducted by individuals or groups who claim to be third party recruiters and/or points of contact for our Company. Examples include sending candidates a request for personal information, conducting online interviews or meetings, making offers of employment, demanding money for employment related services and activities, or asking the applicant to purchase a laptop or other work-related equipment for the job. The aim of the fraud is to obtain personally identifying information (*e.g*., identity theft) and/or money. The Company’s name, as well as the names of employees, are used to try to convey authenticity.

Here are some tips to help you identify and avoid job scams:

1. Always Check the Source:

Ensure that the job listing is on our official website or a reputable job board. Our official domain is https://www.integraconnect.com/resources/careers/. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or social media messages offering job opportunities.

2. Be Wary of Requests for Personal Information:

We will never request sensitive personal information like your Social Security number, bank details, or payment for onboarding/equipment. If you encounter such requests, it’s likely a scam.

3. Verify Contact Information:

Check that the contact information provided in the job posting, including email addresses and phone numbers, aligns with our official contact information. Scammers often use generic or non-company email addresses.

* What is the sender’s email address? Is it consistent with other job postings from this company? Email addresses that are slightly different from any business’s primary contact information (“Jane.Doe@IntegraConnect.org” vs “John.Doe@Integra Connect.com”) are a common warning sign.
* If you are contacted through LinkedIn, be sure to review the entire profile to verify their credentials.

If you suspect that a job offer is fraudulent, we recommend that you do not respond to it.

If you believe you are the victim of any fraudulent activity, you can report it to the appropriate authorities at https://www.myfloridalegal.com/consumer-protection/how-to-protect-yourself-job-listing-and-job-search-firms (Florida Department of State) and/or https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams#report (U.S. Federal Trade Commission).

Integra Connect is not responsible for any fraudulent offers and advises prospective candidates to follow the guidance provided above.

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

**ABOUT THE COMPANY**

Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.

In 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills.

Although we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.

Our customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose Republic Services because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.

Our company values guide our daily actions:

* **Safe**: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities.
* **Committed to Serve**: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations.
* **Environmentally Responsible:** We take action to improve our environment.
* **Driven**: We deliver results in the right way.
* **Human-Centered:** We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.

We are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.

**STRATEGY**

Republic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.

We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.

With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.

**Recycling and Waste**

We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.

**Environmental Solutions**

Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.

**SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION**

Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.

The Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.

We continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.
* **Human-Centered Thinking**: You put learners at the center, designing for relevance, accessibility, and behavioral impact.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.
* **Human-Centered Thinking**: You put learners at the center, designing for relevance, accessibility, and behavioral impact.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.
* **Human-Centered Thinking**: You put learners at the center, designing for relevance, accessibility, and behavioral impact.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.
* **Human-Centered Thinking**: You put learners at the center, designing for relevance, accessibility, and behavioral impact.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.
* **Human-Centered Thinking**: You put learners at the center, designing for relevance, accessibility, and behavioral impact.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.
* **Human-Centered Thinking**: You put learners at the center, designing for relevance, accessibility, and behavioral impact.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.
* **Human-Centered Thinking**: You put learners at the center, designing for relevance, accessibility, and behavioral impact.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.
* **Human-Centered Thinking**: You put learners at the center, designing for relevance, accessibility, and behavioral impact.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.
* **Human-Centered Thinking**: You put learners at the center, designing for relevance, accessibility, and behavioral impact.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.

**About Us:**

For over 35 years, TERREPOWER (formerly BBB Industries) has been a leader in sustainable manufacturing, driving the circular economy by extending the life of essential products in the automotive and industrial markets.

  

Founded in 1987 in Daphne, Alabama by the Bigler family, TERREPOWER began as a small regional remanufacturer of starters and alternators. Our commitment to quality and innovation quickly earned us a reputation as a trusted name in the automotive industry.

  

Recognizing new challenges and opportunities, in 2019 we set our sights on EV battery upcycling-addressing one of the industry’s most pressing issues. Our engineering team pioneered solutions to extend EV battery life, pushing the boundaries of sustainable innovation.

  

Recognizing that demand for solar panels would exceed availability and 100,000 tons of waste would potentially go into landfills by 2035, our team searched for an innovative way to upcycle solar panels. With an eye on the future, we developed ways to upcycle solar panels.

  

Rooted in family and community values, we’re proud to have second-generation employees contributing to our legacy. Backed by Clearlake Capital, we’ve expanded our footprint into Europe with facilities in Spain, Italy, Denmark, Germany and Poland. We now sustainably manufacture and supply an assortment of nondiscretionary repair parts across more than 90 countries.

  

As we move forward under the TERREPOWER name, we remain committed to the same values that have always defined us: entrepreneurship, teamwork, customer-centered, sustainability, safety.

  

**Why Join Us?**

When you join our team, you become part of a company that is redefining how essential products are made, reused and repurposed to reduce waste and maximize resources.

Here’s what sets us apart:

* Purpose-Driven Work – Every day, your work will contribute to extending the useful life of essential products, keeping vehicles on the road and critical systems running.
* Innovative Mindset – We encourage creative problem-solving and bold ideas to push the boundaries of what is possible.
* Global Reach, Local Impact – With operations in North America and Europe, we have a global presence but remain deeply connected to the communities we serve.
* Growth & Development – Whether you’re on the production floor, in engineering, or part of our corporate team, we invest in your success through training, mentorship, and career advancement opportunities.
* A Culture of Collaboration – Rooted in teamwork and shared values, our employees work together to tackle challenges and drive meaningful change.

If you're an executive leader with experience in the business of insurance (e.g., underwriting, claims), combined with a management consulting pedigree, and passionate about client transformation—this is your opportunity to shape how Guidewire delivers value to global insurers.
  
  
**Job Description**
**Value Realization Leadership**

* Co-lead the design, implementation, and governance of a new, outcome-centric Value Realization methodology for Guidewire implementations, shifting away from traditional delivery toward a business impact-focused approach.
* Embed Value Realization principles across the entire customer lifecycle—from pre-sales (Value Roadmapping) to post-go-live optimization.
* Institutionalize the methodology through playbooks, training, and tools used by business consultants and client-facing teams.
* Continuously evaluate, evolve, and improve the methodology based on market trends, customer feedback, and business outcomes.

* Lead the Business Consulting team’s ownership of pre-sales, working in tight alignment with Sales, Customer Success, and Product teams.
* Shape client transformation journeys from the earliest interactions, ensuring Guidewire is positioned as a strategic enabler of outcomes—not just a software vendor.
* Contribute to opportunity shaping and executive communications with prospective clients - often in conjunction with our Systems Integration partners - translating business cases to transformation strategy and roadmap design.

**Practice Development & Thought Leadership**

* Define and execute the global strategy for the Guidewire Business Consulting practice, aligning with company goals and customer needs.
* Build frameworks, best practices, and methods that demonstrate Guidewire’s differentiated business value.
* Represent Guidewire in industry forums, analyst briefings, and executive roundtables to drive thought leadership in insurance transformation.
* Partner with other practice leads to develop and deliver an enablement curriculum aligned with our new methodology, empowering consultants to become trusted advisors.

**Talent Strategy & Methodology Steepening**

* Lead the development of a globally distributed team, primarily composed of Business Architects. Ensure all team members are fully trained in the new Value Realization methodology and capable of delivering outcome-centric consulting engagements.
* Recruit, develop, and retain a team that combines insurance industry experience with consulting rigor.
* Foster a culture of business-first thinking, data-driven insights, and client empathy.
* Encourage specialization in market segments such as London Market, Global Commercial Lines, and Cloud Transformation.

**Practice Performance Management**

* Establish KPIs tied to client business value, practice profitability, and staff development.
* Continuously analyze performance, including adoption and impact of the new methodology, and drive improvements through operational excellence.
* Monitor industry shifts and client expectations to iterate on service offerings and maintain competitive advantage.

**Client Engagement & Relationship Management**

* Build deep executive relationships with global insurance clients. Position Guidewire as a strategic partner committed to long-term success.
* Collaborate with Sales and Customer Success to identify and lead opportunities for business transformation consulting, upsells, and cross-sells, including with our Consulting Partner ecosystem.
* Oversee engagement quality and customer satisfaction across all regions.
* Champion the customer voice in strategic decision-making within the practice.

**Delivery Oversight & Strategic Project Involvement**

* Provide executive oversight of transformation programs where business consulting is critical to value delivery.
* Maintain partial utilization (~40-60% annually) during early phases to personally lead or shape key accounts, mentor leaders, and ensure successful pilot projects of the new methodology.
* Work closely with PMO and delivery teams to ensure projects are scoped, managed, and executed to deliver measurable outcomes.

**People Leadership**

* Inspire and guide a global team of Practice Managers, Business Architects, and Senior Consultants.
* Foster a high-performance culture with strong collaboration, ownership, and career development.
* Serve as a role model and coach, helping team members build both technical fluency and business acumen.
* Promote inclusivity, engagement, and excellence in delivery.

**Qualifications**

* 15+ years of experience in consulting, professional services, or enterprise transformation roles, with a focus on insurance and/or SaaS platforms.
* Strong preference for candidates who have:

+ Worked directly in the business of insurance (e.g., underwriting, claims, operations).
+ Spent time in a top-tier management consulting firm or a boutique consultancy focused on financial services.

* Guidewire InsuranceSuite knowledge or experience (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, ClaimCenter), including implementation and transformation programs.
* Proven success leading practice strategy, new methodology development, or global capability building.
* Extensive experience engaging with senior client stakeholders to drive strategic conversations, roadmap planning, and outcome realization.
* Strong analytical, communication, and storytelling skills. Ability to build business cases, define KPIs, and articulate customer value in compelling terms.
* Demonstrated ability to scale global teams, lead through ambiguity, and influence cross-functionally.
