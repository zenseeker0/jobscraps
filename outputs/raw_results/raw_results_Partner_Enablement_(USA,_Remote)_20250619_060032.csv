When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. and/or Canada locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.

Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday (for non-exempt employees), plus a day off for their birthday. Non-Exempt new hires accrue up to 16 days of vacation time off each year, at a rate of 4.92 hours per pay period. Exempt new hires participate in Cisco’s flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use, but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco’s Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours. Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.

Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:

.75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;

1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;

1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.","","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Cisco","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/b799172fd63cfb12d47f7d0f8f79a90b","http://www.cisco.com","San Jose, CA","10,000+","more than $10B (USD)","Cisco wants you to bring your uniqueness, join teams to solve challenges, and work together to build an inclusive future for all with our technology.

* Define and measure success for communication and enablement initiatives by identifying the right KPIs to track performance. You will regularly synthesize and communicate the purpose and progress of your work to key stakeholders and leadership
* Thoughtfully innovate by pushing the boundaries of how we do things, elevating the team by challenging current processes and articulating a point-of-view to drive change.
* Demonstrate sound judgment by independently considering and prioritizing urgent versus important work and making the right trade-offs to protect bandwidth and drive key results.
* Ensure all communications are ""associate forward,"" putting the needs of our front-line teams at the center of how we share information.

* Model and coach effective communication styles across the organization, guiding partners and leaders on how to tailor their messaging to better connect with their teams

Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.  
  
Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.  
  
As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward's mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.  
  
Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.

### **The Opportunity**

  

We are seeking a mission-driven Clinical Lead to provide clinical and operational oversight to our nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other field-based providers delivering care across Minnesota and Michigan. This leader will play a key role in bridging clinical strategy with day-to-day excellence in care delivery, aligning provider performance with Homeward's standards and value-based care objectives.

### **What You'll Do**

* **Leadership & Oversight** (30%)  
  + Serve as the direct manager of field-based APPs (NPs and PAs), providing coaching, mentorship, and performance management
  + Facilitate consistent execution of care model protocols, workflows, and risk adjustment strategies
  + Oversee PTO planning, approval, and coverage coordination to ensure provider availability and continuity of care
  + Monitor provider scheduling patterns, flag capacity risks, and escalate coverage issues in partnership with operations
  + Partner with Market Medical Directors and Service Unit Leaders to ensure coordinated clinical oversight

* **Clinical Care Delivery** (40%)  
  + Continue to see patients in an outpatient setting, including in-person and virtual visits
  + Conduct wellness visits, chronic disease management, and other clinical services as required
  Model best practices for documentation, quality, and patient engagement

  + Monitor provider KPIs including risk capture, quality scores, and throughput
  + Conduct documentation reviews, provide coding and clinical feedback, and manage performance plans
  Collaborate with clinical quality teams to roll out training and audit processes
* **Cross-Functional Partnership & Strategic Input** (10%)  
  + Work with analytics, product, and operations to refine care delivery tools, documentation workflows, and dashboards
  + Participate in care model evolution discussions and provider enablement pilots

### **Time Allocation Summary**

* 40%: Direct Patient Care
* 30%: Team Management & Coaching
* 20%: Performance Management & Quality Oversight
* 10%: Strategic & Cross-Functional Partnership

**Note**: The balance may flex over time based on provider count and organizational priorities.

* Minimum of 5 years clinical experience, including at least 2 years in a supervisory or lead role
* Strong understanding of value-based care, HCC coding, and clinical documentation integrity
* Proven ability to lead, coach, and inspire multidisciplinary teams
* Excellent collaboration, communication, and change management skills
* Ability to travel in-market 20–30% as needed for in-person team connection and observation

### **Preferred Qualifications**

We are seeking a results-driven, technically fluent Vice President of Sales and Marketing to lead growth initiatives for our B2B contract manufacturing business. Serving tier-1 and tier-2 OEMs in the medical, electrical switchgear, defense and oil & gas. This role will drive strategic expansion through deep customer partnerships, engineered solution selling, and market insight.

* Define and communicate a compelling value proposition for our contract manufacturing capabilities—highlighting engineering support, quality systems (ISO, ITAR, etc.), supply chain reliability, and cost-efficiency.

* Represent the customer voice in capacity planning, CAPEX decisions, and NPI (New Product Introduction) readiness reviews.
* Build and scale a sales and marketing organization that aligns with revenue growth targets and operational maturity.

**Work Environment****:**

* Manufacturing floor environment with exposure to machine noise, plastics dust, coolants, and moving machinery.
* Exposure to machine shop conditions including noise, coolants, and fine particulates.

* Ability to stand for extended periods.
* Must be able to lift up to 40lbs at a time.

* 10–15 years of progressive experience in B2B sales and marketing within manufacturing, with a strong preference for contract manufacturing or capital equipment environments.
* Demonstrated success in selling to OEMs—navigating multi-stakeholder buying processes and multi-year contracts.
* Strong grasp of technical manufacturing processes (e.g., CNC machining, assembly, metal fabrication, electronics integration).
* Familiarity with regulatory, quality, and operational standards in capital equipment or industrial OEM sectors.
* Bachelor’s degree in Engineering, Manufacturing, or Business. MBA or equivalent leadership training preferred.

Overview

Manager of Associate Enablement & Communications - Customer Protection Operations (Hybrid)

As the Manager of Associate Enablement & Communications on the Customer Protection (CP) Chief of Staff team, you will serve as the end-to-end owner of the communications and enablement strategy for our CP Operations organization. Reporting to the CP Chief of Staff, your work is about creating connection in every sense: you will connect associates to the tactical information they need to succeed, from critical process changes to daily operational updates. At the same time, you will connect them to their senior leaders, ensuring leadership messages land with impact and that our global team feels seen and heard. Ultimately, you will empower our front-line associates by ensuring they are informed, engaged, and prepared to deliver an exceptional customer experience. While your primary focus will be on the Customer Protection Ops organization, you will capitalize on opportunities to scale your efforts to CP's broader non-exempt population when appropriate

More than a compelling storyteller, we are looking for a true end-to-end strategist and a well-managed executor. The ideal candidate is an expert in stakeholder management who builds productive relationships with partners at all levels, from front-line associates to senior leaders. You excel at translating high-level strategy into compelling narratives that resonate across the organization, bringing structure to ambiguity, and leading complex, open-ended problem solving. Success in this role requires operating autonomously with an emphasis on well-managed execution, demonstrating sound judgment to make the right trade-offs, and maintaining an 'associate-forward' mindset in every decision.

**What We’re Looking For In This Role**

**Lead Strategic Associate Communications & Enablement**

* Serve as the end-to-end owner of the Operations Enablement & Communications strategy, from initial concept to final execution.
* Proactively gather input from stakeholders to shape direction and build business consensus, while establishing connection points with other LOBs to inform a holistic communications and enablement strategy.
* Structure and solve medium-to-high complexity, open-ended problems, applying a structured analytical approach even when information isn’t perfect.
* Define and measure success for communication and enablement initiatives by identifying the right KPIs to track performance. You will regularly synthesize and communicate the purpose and progress of your work to key stakeholders and leadership
* Thoughtfully innovate by pushing the boundaries of how we do things, elevating the team by challenging current processes and articulating a point-of-view to drive change.
* Demonstrate sound judgment by independently considering and prioritizing urgent versus important work and making the right trade-offs to protect bandwidth and drive key results.
* Ensure all communications are ""associate forward,"" putting the needs of our front-line teams at the center of how we share information.
* Create clear, well-formatted, and insightful communications with minimal manager revision needed to get to a final polished product.
* Actively seek out and leverage new technologies, including generative AI tools like Gemini, to innovate and amplify the productivity and impact of communication and enablement strategies.
* Strategically determine and leverage the most effective communication channels—from Slack and email to leadership messages and town halls—to maximize message impact and ensure consistency
* Model and coach effective communication styles across the organization, guiding partners and leaders on how to tailor their messaging to better connect with their teams

**Location:**West Creek 5 (Richmond, VA) or Center 2 (McLean, VA) - this role is Hybrid, where you will be expected to spend 3 days per week working in office and the remainder of the week working virtually.

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

No visa sponsorship available. Must be a US Citizen (no Greencards). Looking for candidates located in the Austin, TX with travel to Cedar Park, TX (HQ) and Florida/other. Able to work remotely.

**An idea was born.**

Since 2018, Terradepth has been gaining attention in both the government and commercial organizations. Like many great ideas, Terradepth started on the back of a napkin, but it didn’t stay there. Our CEO, Joe Wolfel, a former Navy SEAL, saw an idea of how to disrupt the way the world looks at the ocean and voila, Terradepth was born.

**Why “fit” matters.**

Let’s start with you! If you meet our requirements for the role, and this sounds like you, you may just be the person we are looking for:

* **Do you have an entrepreneurial mindset?** We are a fast-paced, dynamic startup environment where you will drive product marketing, operate independently and resourcefully to build things from the ground up. This is a skilled hands-on marketer and product marketing leadership role.
* **Are you data driven?** Have you successfully gone after and analyzed market data and customer insights to help drive decisions and make improvements (I.e. setting and tracking KPI).
* **Industry background:** Do you have a background in hydrography, hydrographic survey, oceanography, maritime robotics, bathymetry, acoustic sensing, acoustic sensor data processing, or similar fields?

Given all that, it’s not going to matter how smart or competent you are if you’re not a good cultural fit. We demand that our people adhere to our values: Speed, Discipline, and Collaboration. We also expect team cohesion while avoiding groupthink – which is a difficult balance to maintain. Before we get into the details of the day-to-day duties, let’s get down to the ocean floor. What you do, How you do it, and Why you want to work here matters. Think you’ve checked all those boxes?...then keep on reading.

**The ocean is our swim lane.**

We are increasing human interaction with the ocean by using our high-tech autonomous submersibles to collect comprehensive, high-resolution ocean data. We do this to empower society with information and knowledge crucial to the sustainable advancement of a variety of key industries. Interested? Great! Immerse yourself and see if you have the fins to swim in our pool.

**Our Peeps.**

We are ocean enthusiasts, technologists, problem solvers, and makers dedicated to advancing ocean exploration. We are pioneers and made up of, to name a few…road bikers, chess players, dog lovers, world travelers, military veterans, and an array of individuals with diverse technical backgrounds. We have family people, single people and people who refer people. And if we’re being honest…we like each other.

**Getting into the details.**

As we continue to bring awareness of Terradepth to the marketplace, we are looking for an exceptional Director of Product Marketing. As a key member of Terradepth’s team, the Director of Product Marketing is responsible for the positioning, messaging, and go-to-market for our products and services across commercial and government markets. This role requires developing a detailed understanding of customer personas, their “jobs to be done”, the customer’s buyer journey, and translating this understanding into compelling content, tools, and programs for our customers, sales team, and partners. The Director of Product Marketing develops and executes product marketing plans, manages product launches, and with marketing, drives market adoption and sales growth. The role collaborates with cross-functional teams, including Product Management, Marketing, Product Development, Sales, and Customer Support, provides input to the product roadmap, and ensures that the customer’s buying experience exceeds market expectations and achieves business objectives. The Director of Product Marketing will scale the product marketing function as Terradepth’s business and product family grows.

Teamwork, accountability, partnership, and leadership are key traits we look for. As team-members we strive to be humble enough to learn but confident enough to execute. We love curiosity without distraction. As leaders in our organization and threaded into our day-to-day activities it is our commitment to support, invest in and stretch our employees to help them achieve their ultimate career goals.

Why Figment?**

**Figment** powers the future of Web3 through industry-leading blockchain infrastructure. As the leading provider of staking solutions, **we help 500+ institutional clients optimize their crypto rewards**, including top exchanges, asset managers, wallets, foundations, custodians, and major token holders. Our clients trust Figment for a comprehensive suite of services, including **reward optimization**, **cutting-edge API development**, detailed **rewards reporting**, seamless **partner integrations**, **governance support**, and **slashing protection**.

Backed by a team of passionate and intelligent Figmates, with a **100% remote-first** global presence across **12 countries**, our company is on a mission to accelerate the adoption, growth, and long-term success of the Web3 ecosystem. We're building the infrastructure that will power the decentralized future.

We are also looking for true teammates - people who are genuine, humble, and driven to level up together. If you're excited to shape the future, contribute to an **energetic company culture**, and work at the cutting edge of blockchain technology, we want you to join our team and help us lead the charge!

### **About the opportunity**

We're looking for a **Director of Product Marketing - Sales Enablement** who deeply understands the institutional digital asset space — especially staking — and can craft compelling narratives that showcase Figment's differentiation with institutional audiences globally.

This is not your average Director of Product Marketing role. Yes, we need strong messaging, positioning, and go-to-market support. But above all, we're looking for a clear thinker and exceptional messenger in a rapidly evolving category who can:

* Break down complex product concepts and differentiators into crisp, buyer-relevant messaging
* Mine customer questions and Buyer Group insights and turn them efficiently into scalable GTM materials at the pace of digital asset staking's rapid growth
* Write sales pitches that resonate with financial institutions and respect a highly and rapidly evolving regulatory environment
* Surface and uniquely package the value of Figment's People, Products and Performance
* Help our sales team and customers understand Figment's product and protocol roadmap

You've been a sales engineer, technical marketer, or product-oriented pitch creator in crypto, and you know what institutions care about.

This role will have three direct reports: Protocol Marketing lead, Marketing Operations Coordinator, and Product Marketing Manager - Sales Enablement (APAC).

### **How you will make an impact**

**Positioning & Messaging**

* Develop differentiated messaging and clear value propositions for our staking infrastructure
* Articulate how Figment stands out from other staking providers in terms of compliance, security, architecture, and track record
* Create product narratives tailored to specific Buyer Groups (e.g. custodians, exchanges, asset managers)

**Sales Enablement**

* Write compelling pitch decks and sales collateral for new and existing product offerings
* Partner with Sales and RevOps to understand what resonates, where we win/lose, and where messaging needs to evolve
* Work closely with the central Partner Marketing team and key partners (e.g., exchanges, custodians, institutional players) to create joint marketing materials (sales enablement), case studies, and co-branded campaigns.

**Go-to-Market Support**

* Own launch messaging and positioning for new protocols and products
* Support campaign and event programming with key inputs: target audiences, key messages, content briefs

Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time check— is essential.

It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law.

Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.

In the United States, compensation offered will be determined by factors such as location, job level, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience.

Mozilla Corporation is the non-profit-backed technology company that has shaped the internet for the better over the last 25 years. We make pioneering brands like Firefox, the privacy-minded web browser, and Pocket, a service for keeping up with the best content online. Now, with more than 225 million people around the world using our products each month, we’re shaping the next 25 years of technology and helping to reclaim an internet built for people, not companies. Our work focuses on diverse areas including AI, social media, security and more. And we’re doing this while never losing our focus on our core mission – to make the internet better for people.

The Mozilla Corporation is wholly owned by the non-profit 501(c) Mozilla Foundation. This means we aren’t beholden to any shareholders — only to our mission. Along with thousands of volunteer contributors and collaborators all over the world, Mozillians design, build and distribute **open-source** software that enables people to enjoy the internet on their terms.

### **Role Summary**

The Chief of Staff to SVP, Strategy & Ops is a strategic partner and force multiplier, enabling high-leverage execution across Mozilla Corporation’s growth-critical domains: strategy, monetization, data, advertising, customer experience, trust & safety, and business operations. This senior role is central to driving coherence, speed, and impact across MoCo’s most pivotal cross-functional initiatives.

This is a builder-operator role for someone who can architect operating models, drive executive forums, and embed accountability frameworks—while also getting hands-on to resolve bottlenecks and deliver outcomes.

This role is distinct from Mozilla.org’s portfolio-level Chief of Staff and is designed for a proven leader ready to help steward the organization’s role in Mozilla’s transformation and deliver execution excellence in a rapidly evolving business.

### **Key Responsibilities**

#### **1. Strategic Program Leadership**

* Lead or co-lead cross-functional, high-impact initiatives within Mozilla Corporation (e.g., optimization projects, AI integration initiatives).
* Operationalize strategic imperatives into workstreams with timelines, clear milestones, and cross-org accountability structures.
* Resolve cross-functional ambiguity and execution misalignment by coordinating with the SVP’s senior leadership team and other MoCo execs.

#### **2. Team Operating Model & Governance**

* Design and evolve the operating rhythm for Strategy & Ops: QBRs, offsites, leadership forums, and cross-functional check-ins.
* Ensure Strategy & Ops priorities are integrated into MoCo-level strategic planning, execution dashboards, and board-level communications.
* Maintain shared operating artifacts like team-wide scorecards, authority matrices, initiative tracking, and milestone reviews.

#### **3. Cross-Org Collaboration & Communication**

* Serve as the connective tissue between Strategy & Ops teams (includes: Strategy, Monetization teams, Ops, Data, Ads Product & Eng) and peer organizations across MoCo.
* Lead the coordination and content development for strategic planning inputs, OKRs, investment proposals, and executive narratives.
* Support org-wide storytelling by drafting SVP communications and presentation materials.

#### **4. Decision Support & SVP Leverage**

* Act as a strategic advisor and counsel to the SVP—helping prioritize time, decision-making focus, and organizational attention.
* Drive clarity, structure, and action in ambiguous or emergent strategic opportunities.
* Represent the SVP in meetings and working groups when needed, ensuring progress continues without introducing friction or overhead.

#### **5. Org Effectiveness & Culture Enablement**

* Champion operating efficiency, working to “lift the load” across SODA teams by identifying redundant processes and unlocking execution velocity.
* Role-model Mozilla’s culture of mission-first, high-trust, low-ego collaboration—driving cross-team accountability and alignment without drama.
* Act as a cultural barometer — surfacing emerging team dynamics, spotting where clarity or support is needed, and helping the SVP calibrate leadership energy/focus as the team expands its remit and internal influence.

### **What You Bring**

#### **Experience**

* **12+ years** of experience in business operations, strategic program management, or Chief of Staff roles, preferably within product-led or mission-driven tech companies.
* Experience running executive-level operations or complex programs involving multiple functions (e.g., strategy, marketing, product, data).
* Proven success managing high-visibility initiatives in ambiguous, evolving org environments.
* Prior work with executive leadership, boards, or strategy teams is strongly preferred.

#### **Skills & Attributes**

* Exceptional operator: able to zoom out to strategy and zoom in to execution bottlenecks—without skipping a beat.
* Clear communicator, able to synthesize complexity into crisp plans and materials for execs and ICs alike.
* Trusted influencer who can lead without authority in high-context, high-trust environments.
* Systems thinker with a bias for structured execution, crisp prioritization, and unrelenting clarity.
* Deep alignment with Mozilla’s mission and values.
* Be proactive, move fast, communicate early, and ship results.

**What you’ll get:**

* Generous performance-based bonus plans to all regular employees - we share in our success as one team
* Rich medical, dental, and vision coverage
* Generous retirement contributions with 100% immediate vesting (regardless of whether you contribute)
* Quarterly all-company wellness days where everyone takes a pause together
* Country specific holidays plus a day off for your birthday
* One-time home office stipend
* Annual professional development budget
* Quarterly well-being stipend
* Considerable paid parental leave
* Employee referral bonus program
* Other benefits (life/AD&D, disability, EAP, etc. - varies by country)

**Strategic Accounts Customer Success Manager**
**About The Role**
As a Strategic Accounts Customer Success Manager, you will be the face of Motive for our largest customers. You will be responsible for assisting customers through the implementation process, proactively working to achieve and maintain full customer satisfaction for the duration of their product subscription while driving upsells and renewals. As a member of a fast-paced and tight-knit team, you will help support product and business development to satisfy customer needs along with developing internal tools to help the business gain scale.
  
  
**What You’ll Do**

* Establish and oversee the customer's continued adoption, training, and development of best practices to continually drive incremental value and return on the customer's investment
* Develop strong working relationships at multiple management levels within the customer accounts, including C Suite relationships
* Collaborate with customers and product managers to manage product enhancement requests
* Act as a subject matter expert on customer product features for strategic accounts
* Manage initiatives to increase product adoption and customer satisfaction
* Continually learn about the needs of the client at all levels by proactively uncovering emerging pain points and expectations to get a clearer picture of how Motive can address problems and create satisfying solutions and outcomes
* Work collaboratively as part of the customer team by partnering, building plans, and communicating with AEs, the Onboarding team, Professional Services, Sales Engineers, and other internal colleagues to ensure aligned customer engagement and effective support
* Maintain high renewal rates by demonstrating value, supporting goal attainment, and identifying opportunities for optimization
* Identify upsell and expansion opportunities to grow the NRR for your book while ensuring renewal and retention metrics are exceeded
* Gather intelligence on how customers are using products and determine features and services that are most valuable to their businesses
* Act as an escalation point for all customers
* Identify areas for improvement in customer experience in the product and processes

**What We’re Looking For**

* 5+ years Enterprise Customer Success, Sales, or Account Management experience with a proven track record of success
* A customer-centric thinker with a track record of delivering scalable solutions in a high-growth environment
* Demonstrated ability in learning new software programs and products while identifying opportunities to use them to their full potential
* Ability to thrive in a high-growth, high-ambiguity environment; setting personal objectives and prioritizing impact-based activities.
* Exceptional account management skills and project management skills with strict attention to detail
* Problem solver with demonstrated ability to overcome challenges and ambiguity with creative solutions

**Competencies**

* Execution: Strategic Accounts Customer Success Managers (CSM) own a book of business averaging 5-8 clients or ~$ 5-8MM in ARR. CSMs conduct planned and time-gated outbound activities that enable client outcomes, communicate value, and identify new growth opportunities.
* Domain Expertise: Strategic Accounts CSMs' execution is tailored to the cohort of clients within their book of business. Caring for a specific client type not only leverages their deep knowledge of CS and Motive but also requires them to become an expert in a particular niche.
* User Focus: Strategic Accounts CSMs enable clients to extract value from Motive’s products and solutions through activities like training and adoption. Strategic ENT CSMs have a sharper focus on particular cohorts of the account base in which their activities/suggestions are more targeted. They use their expertise to expand usage and drive value far beyond the initial purchase reasons.
* Collaboration: Strategic Accounts CSMs are the internal advocate for Motive’s customers. They escalate issues to key business partners, including escalating up leadership chains, in order to drive resolution. CSMs coordinate and lead EBRs that include AEs and other internal stakeholders. CSMs also participate routinely in identifying clients for BETA programs, references, and case studies.
* Problem Solving: Strategic Accounts CSMs are capable of driving resolution cross-functionally, independent of leadership involvement. Their ability to proactively tackle problems and manage them to completion separates Motive from competitors.

**Duties/Functions**
**Specialized Book of Business: Strategic Accounts CSMs care for special cohorts within the ENT segment, which includes Partner (e.g, Insurance), New Client (Adoption), and Mature (fully penetrated) accounts.**

* Client Enablement: Strategic Accounts ensure clients are capable of extracting value from Motive’s products and services through adoption activities, new feature training, and providing suggestions on how to best leverage the platform.
* Value Realization: Strategic Accounts CSMs communicate value to clients through conducting joint success planning, business reviews, and providing data to demonstrate return on investment.
* Client Marketing: Strategic Accounts CSMs engage clients about thought leadership and new products framed around the value they create, which in turn leads to cross-sell opportunities for sales. CSMs also capture organic upsells through natural touchpoints.
* Renewal Management: Strategic Accounts CSMs ensure clients have a great experience and extract value, turning the renewal into a predetermined event. Renewal Managers partner with CSMs to ensure the most value possible is extracted for Motive, while retaining the most units possible, driving profitability.
* Escalation Management: Strategic Accounts CSMs proactively advocate for clients by escalating internally to prevent the need for the client to escalate. When clients do escalate, the CSM leads the engagement to drive swift resolution.
* Account Stewardship: Strategic Accounts CSMs act as the main point of contact to guide clients through working with Motive as a company. Any non-selling activity becomes the CSM's responsibility to champion.
* Technical Expert: Strategic Accounts CSMs act as a consultant and first line of triage. Their technical skill aids clients in maximizing value, becoming self-reliant, and reducing unnecessary tier 1 support needs.

***Pay Transparency**
Your compensation may be based on several factors, including education, work experience, and certifications. For certain roles, total compensation may include restricted stock units.
