We have zero tolerance for bureaucracy, office politics, and lean-back personalities.

As a Public Benefit Corporation and a certified B-Corp, we deliver environmental and social impact using our products and tech. Through our Giveback program, we partner with organizations such as the ACLU, New Story, The Humane Society, Malala Fund, American Red Cross, 360.org, charity: water, and dozens of others, and have donated millions towards reforestation, education, animal rights, LGBTQ+ causes, access to water, and more.

--------------

The Farmer's Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.  
  
To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.

#LongLiveDogs

**What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In**
----------------------------------------------

We're looking for a Brand Marketing Manager to develop communications strategies and innovative marketing solutions that will help us achieve our business objectives and strengthen our position in the minds of dog lovers. You'll use your expertise in brand strategy and communications planning to translate consumer and category data and insights into actionable plans and creative briefs across channels. Your knowledge of how to resonate with and inspire action in our consumer will be critical to making more people aware of The Farmer's Dog and familiar with our unique offering so that we can serve more dogs.

**One Team:** We don't think of ourselves as ""Acquisition Marketers"", ""Engineers"", ""Data Analysts"", or ""Product Managers"". Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER – getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.

**We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:** Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems.

**We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:** We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.

**We Execute For Impact:** We don't subscribe to ""best practices"" or ""industry KPIs"". We're uninterested in how we compare to ""benchmarks""; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles – i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.

**We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption**: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, ""what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?"". We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time.

**How You'll Make An Impact**
-----------------------------

* Identify opportunities for marketing communications and develop actionable plans that align with the company's objectives across owned and paid channels.
* Craft creative briefs and messaging strategies across paid and owned channels. This includes synthesizing performance data, consumer research, and social listening to refine concepts that better resonate with our consumer and drive improved performance.
* Contribute to and/or lead the development of compelling marketing collateral that effectively communicates our brand message, including advertising campaigns, digital content, experiential, and more.
* Be the expert in competitive analysis and category trends. Help us stay smart and make recommendations to differentiate our product and service.
* Contribute to annual marketing planning and brand positioning initiatives in collaboration with Brand Marketing Director.
* Contribute to consumer research efforts including advertising creative pre-testing, advertising creative measurement, and consumer / market research in partnership with Consumer Research and/or Data Science functions.
* Collaborate with cross-functional partners to ensure brand consistency and alignment across all touchpoints.

**We're Excited About You Because**
-----------------------------------

* You have a minimum of 5 years of experience in a Brand Strategy or Communications Planning role, preferably within an ad agency environment.
* You have strong creative and strategic instincts and a proven track record of translating consumer, category, and insights into compelling creative briefs across a variety of campaign types. Experience with digital-first and/or ""non-traditional"" campaigns a plus.
* You are proficient in Communications / Go-To-Market Planning and know how to ensure channels work together effectively toward a common marketing goal.
* You're energized about finding innovative marketing solutions to business problems, applying traditional strategic thinking in original ways, and are always seeking better rather than filling a plan.
* You are familiar with consumer research / creative testing and have strong analytical skills, with the ability to interpret data and insights to inform decision-making.
* You're an owner, self-starter, and problem-solver who is able to drive projects forward in a fast-paced and ambiguous environment.
* You have a passion for creative excellence and fluency in communicating with creative and production teams.
* You have excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both internal teams and external partners.
* You love dogs.

**Office Guidelines**
---------------------

We are an in-office culture, made of in-office people who thrive on the collaboration and magnetism of working in a shared space. We are seeking individuals who excel in this type of environment, where being present fosters deeper connections and engagement.

**Our Belonging Philosophy:**
-----------------------------

Our company's mission is rooted in deep, genuine care for dogs – and for the people who love them. As an organization we are full of individuals who are unique in many ways, but all united in a mission of providing true peace of mind to dog lovers everywhere. Fixing this industry and improving the lives of pets and their people will be a difficult, decades-long endeavor. We believe the best use of our time, energy, and resources as a collective team is to focus on this mission, and on supporting our team to do their best work and be their best selves. In support of this we're committed to supporting a diverse workforce, and investing in internal structures, opportunities, and training that create and sustain an inclusive team. We strive to provide an experience at TFD that will be invested, meaningful and memorable as we progress on the journey to reimagine how we feed and care for our pets.

**A Few of Our Best Benefits**
------------------------------

* Dog-friendly office in Greenwich Village
* Market-competitive compensation and equity packages
* Comprehensive Healthcare, Dental, and Vision
* Company supported mental health benefits
* 12 week paid parental leave
* Competitive 401k plan with company match
* Flexible PTO
* Discounted fresh food for your pup
* Your pet interrupting video calls (and in-person meetings) is now a feature, not a bug

We commit to building a competitive compensation package and company environment for all individuals to thrive. We believe in competitive base compensation rooted in location specific market data and performance along with equity ownership in the company that allows every team member to build their personal wealth as the company grows, just as much as we believe in fostering a culture that supports our team members personally, professionally, and holistically. **For this role the anticipated hiring base compensation range is $105,000 - $130,000 USD Annual and the compensation offered will include a robust market competitive package of base and equity.** In addition to your base compensation offer you will also receive equity ownership in the company. More information about the value of this equity will be shared at the time of offer. This range is representative of NYC Market Data if you are applying to this role outside of the NYC area the range may change.

No visa sponsorship available. Must be a US Citizen (no Greencards). Looking for candidates located in the Austin, TX with travel to Cedar Park, TX (HQ) and Florida/other. Able to work remotely.

**An idea was born.**

Since 2018, Terradepth has been gaining attention in both the government and commercial organizations. Like many great ideas, Terradepth started on the back of a napkin, but it didn’t stay there. Our CEO, Joe Wolfel, a former Navy SEAL, saw an idea of how to disrupt the way the world looks at the ocean and voila, Terradepth was born.

**Why “fit” matters.**

Let’s start with you! If you meet our requirements for the role, and this sounds like you, you may just be the person we are looking for:

* **Do you have an entrepreneurial mindset?** We are a fast-paced, dynamic startup environment where you will drive product marketing, operate independently and resourcefully to build things from the ground up. This is a skilled hands-on marketer and product marketing leadership role.
* **Are you data driven?** Have you successfully gone after and analyzed market data and customer insights to help drive decisions and make improvements (I.e. setting and tracking KPI).
* **Industry background:** Do you have a background in hydrography, hydrographic survey, oceanography, maritime robotics, bathymetry, acoustic sensing, acoustic sensor data processing, or similar fields?

Given all that, it’s not going to matter how smart or competent you are if you’re not a good cultural fit. We demand that our people adhere to our values: Speed, Discipline, and Collaboration. We also expect team cohesion while avoiding groupthink – which is a difficult balance to maintain. Before we get into the details of the day-to-day duties, let’s get down to the ocean floor. What you do, How you do it, and Why you want to work here matters. Think you’ve checked all those boxes?...then keep on reading.

**The ocean is our swim lane.**

We are increasing human interaction with the ocean by using our high-tech autonomous submersibles to collect comprehensive, high-resolution ocean data. We do this to empower society with information and knowledge crucial to the sustainable advancement of a variety of key industries. Interested? Great! Immerse yourself and see if you have the fins to swim in our pool.

**Our Peeps.**

We are ocean enthusiasts, technologists, problem solvers, and makers dedicated to advancing ocean exploration. We are pioneers and made up of, to name a few…road bikers, chess players, dog lovers, world travelers, military veterans, and an array of individuals with diverse technical backgrounds. We have family people, single people and people who refer people. And if we’re being honest…we like each other.

**Getting into the details.**

As we continue to bring awareness of Terradepth to the marketplace, we are looking for an exceptional Director of Product Marketing. As a key member of Terradepth’s team, the Director of Product Marketing is responsible for the positioning, messaging, and go-to-market for our products and services across commercial and government markets. This role requires developing a detailed understanding of customer personas, their “jobs to be done”, the customer’s buyer journey, and translating this understanding into compelling content, tools, and programs for our customers, sales team, and partners. The Director of Product Marketing develops and executes product marketing plans, manages product launches, and with marketing, drives market adoption and sales growth. The role collaborates with cross-functional teams, including Product Management, Marketing, Product Development, Sales, and Customer Support, provides input to the product roadmap, and ensures that the customer’s buying experience exceeds market expectations and achieves business objectives. The Director of Product Marketing will scale the product marketing function as Terradepth’s business and product family grows.

Teamwork, accountability, partnership, and leadership are key traits we look for. As team-members we strive to be humble enough to learn but confident enough to execute. We love curiosity without distraction. As leaders in our organization and threaded into our day-to-day activities it is our commitment to support, invest in and stretch our employees to help them achieve their ultimate career goals.

**Job Description**



California’s Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) is transforming how behavioral health care is delivered across the state. The Behavioral Health Transformation (BHT) project represents a historic investment in systems change. Our work enables counties, providers, and state staff to deliver more coordinated, equitable, and outcomes-driven behavioral health services for all Californians. BHT is a once-in-a-generation effort to transform behavioral health service delivery for California’s most vulnerable populations. We are building a team of mission-driven, systems-minded professionals who can steward this transformation. 
  



The BHT initiative is a multi-year effort to re-architect the way DHCS partners with counties and providers to deliver care, measure outcomes, and support system accountability. This work requires a new generation of digital tools, data infrastructure, and service delivery models. At its core, BHT is about making real changes in the lives of Californians—ensuring every dollar spent can be tied to improved access, quality, and health outcomes. We are seeking a strategic, systems-minded Principal Product Manager to mature our Data, Analytics & Reporting capability for BHT.
**In this role, you will be accountable for ensuring DHCS can answer the fundamental question:
*What impact are we making with the behavioral health dollars we invest?***



To do this, you will drive the product strategy for how DHCS collects, manages, and reports on individual- and service-level behavioral health data from counties and providers. Your work will shape how the state builds transparency, strengthens accountability, and drives evidence-based improvements across the behavioral health delivery system.
  



This is a high-impact, high-visibility individual contributor role. You’ll work cross-functionally with policy, program, and data teams across DHCS, as well as with counties, and behavioral health providers. Your focus will be turning fragmented and duplicative reporting practices into streamlined, user-centered solutions that deliver timely and accurate insight into the performance of the behavioral health system.
  



**Key Responsibilities**

* Define and own business problem, opportunity development, and product vision development for Data Analytics & Reporting within the BHT portfolio, aligning it with policy mandates, BHT program outcomes, and user needs.
* Identify, understand, and validate high-value use cases that require better access to individual- and service-level data.
* Lead discovery with counties and providers to surface pain points in today’s data submission processes and translate those into actionable product requirements.
* Collaborate with data engineering, analytics, and reporting teams to ensure tools and systems are designed around real-world workflows—not abstract models.
* Drive cross-functional alignment among internal data teams, program teams and external stakeholders to build shared ownership of data solutions.
* Communicate tradeoffs, roadmap priorities, and expected outcomes to technical and non-technical stakeholders and executives.
* Support the development of consistent, actionable reporting that enables DHCS to meet its transparency, accountability, and equity goals under BHT

**Who We’re Looking For**



This role is ideal for someone who thrives at the intersection of
**strategy, data, and user experience**
. You must be able to think in systems, while staying grounded in the concrete needs of users across government, counties, and provider organizations.
  



To be successful in this role, you:

* Are a
  **problem-first, not tool-first**
  thinker. You lead with real-world pain points and design solutions backward from need—not technology.
* Excel at
  **turning ambiguity into clarity**
  . You bring structure to complex issues and help teams align around practical next steps.
* Have a deep appreciation for how
  **policy, people, and data systems**
  interact in large organizations.
* Know how to
  **listen and translate**
  —surfacing needs across diverse stakeholders and turning them into shared outcomes and concrete action.
* Are impact-oriented. You focus on
  **shipping usable solutions**
  , not just defining elegant frameworks.

**Minimum Qualifications**

* 8+ years in product management, data strategy, public sector analytics, or related fields.
* Proven track record of developing data or reporting solutions in complex stakeholder environments.
* Experience working with public sector, care, or behavioral health data.
* Strong communication and stakeholder management skills, particularly across technical and program audiences.
* Experience with data governance, reporting pipelines, and performance measurement approaches.

**Preferred Qualifications**

* Experience with EHR systems and behavioral healthcare provider reporting workflows.
* Understanding of California’s behavioral health system, SB 326, AB 531, or related mandates.
