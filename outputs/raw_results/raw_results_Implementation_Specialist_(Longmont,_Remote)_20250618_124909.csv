CIS Controls Implementation Specialist (8-12 Week Contract, Remote Within the U.S.)

Sora is reimagining education for the modern learner. As a fully accredited, online, project-based school for middle and high school students, we empower students to pursue their passions while receiving a world-class education. Our innovative, flexible approach allows students to excel academically while dedicating time to their athletic, artistic, and personal pursuits.
The Role:

Sora Schools is looking for a collaborative, flexible professional to help us implement the CIS Controls Implementation Group 1 (IG1) cybersecurity framework. This is a project-based, contract role focused on strengthening the security of our fully online learning environment. As a virtual middle and high school, our systems and workflows are unique, so we’re looking for someone who can adapt security best practices to fit how we operate.

In this role, you’ll be responsible for leading the full implementation of the CIS IG1 framework across Sora Schools. That means evaluating our current tools, policies, and practices, identifying gaps, and taking ownership of the necessary adjustments to close them. You'll be expected to collaborate closely with our team to design and execute a clear implementation plan, recommend and configure tools, create or revise documentation, and advise on internal processes and policies. While you’ll collaborate closely with our team, the responsibility for delivering a fully implemented and operational framework will rest with you. We’re looking for someone who communicates clearly, collaborates easily with cross-functional teams, and can tailor security solutions to an education-first, cloud-native environment.

The ideal candidate has hands-on experience with CIS Controls and has supported similar implementation projects, especially in virtual, cloud-based, or education settings. If you're proactive, solution-oriented, and excited to help a mission-driven organization build a stronger security foundation, we’d love to work with you.
Compensation and Location

Compensation for this role is $30/hr for this role. We are open to either 40hr/week or 20hr/week.

To be considered for this role, you must be located in the United States. This is a fully remote role expected to last about 8–12 weeks, with flexible scheduling as long as project milestones are met.
What You'll Do
• Conduct a comprehensive assessment of our current tools, policies, and systems against the CIS IG1 controls
• Identify security gaps and create a prioritized implementation plan tailored to a cloud-native, education-first organization
• Recommend, configure, and deploy tools and workflows to meet IG1 control requirements
• Create or revise documentation, including policies, procedures, and staff guidance
• Collaborate with team members across functions to align on security needs and ensure smooth implementation
• Track progress, report on milestones, and adjust the plan as needed to stay on schedule
• Deliver a fully implemented, operational, and documented CIS IG1 framework by the end of the project
What We're Looking For
• Hands-on implementation of CIS Controls, especially IG1
• Strong understanding of cybersecurity in cloud-based environments
• Ability to work independently and manage a project end-to-end
• Strong communication and collaboration skills

Accommodation Request:

Please let your Sora contact know if you would like to request reasonable accommodations during your application or interviewing process.
