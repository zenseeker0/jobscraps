DoorDash, Inc.

San Francisco, CA; Sunnyvale, CA; Seattle, WA; New York, NY

About the Team

The Storage teams build and operate online stateful systems and abstractions that are reliable, efficient, secure and easy to use for DoorDash Engineering. The teams are responsible for understanding Product Engineering’s evolving needs and developing platform and infrastructure capabilities to serve them. The team currently supports CockroachDB, Cassandra, Kafka and Redis as well as data abstraction services to reduce the complexity of interacting with storage systems for Product Engineers.

About the Role

We’re hiring a Data Solutions Engineer with deep expertise in distributed databases, particularly Apache Cassandra, Redis, Kafka, and database agnostic abstractions. In this role, you will design, optimize, and scale distributed data access layers that power DoorDash’s most critical systems, ensuring high availability, low latency, and fault tolerance.

You’ll serve as a hands-on architect and technical partner to product engineering and infrastructure teams, helping translate complex business requirements into resilient and scalable data models. Your work will directly influence the evolution of Taulu, DoorDash’s unified storage abstraction layer, by shaping best practices and identifying platform gaps through real world engagements.

This is a high-impact, cross functional role that combines deep technical expertise with a customer centric approach. You’ll lead solutioning engagements from design through production, drive the adoption of Taulu modeling best practices, and ensure that our systems meet goals around reliability, cost efficiency, and velocity. You must be located in San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Seattle or New York for this hybrid opportunity.

You’re excited about this opportunity because you will…

* Design and implement highly scalable, fault tolerant distributed database solutions using Taulu, Apache Cassandra, Redis, Kafka, and other paved path storage solutions.
* Architect and optimize multi-region, globally distributed systems to meet our high standards for availability, latency, and throughput.
* Lead data modeling, performance tuning, and capacity planning for large-scale, mission-critical storage workloads.
* Partner with product engineering and infrastructure teams to deeply understand domain specific data needs and guide them in adopting paved path storage solutions.
* Serve as the DRI for solutioning engagements, owning modeling in Taulu from experimentation through launch and scale.
* Shape the evolution of Taulu by identifying abstraction gaps and converting customer feedback into platform improvements.
* Apply workload-aware design patterns, including caching strategies, partitioning, and consistency tuning to improve performance and efficiency.
* Drive adoption of operational best practices across observability, schema design, capacity planning, and cost optimization across storage systems.
* Promote clarity and continuity by contributing to solutioning playbooks, decision logs, and architectural documentation.

We’re excited about you because…

* You have 5+ years of experience designing and scaling distributed data systems, with deep expertise in NoSQL technologies like Apache Cassandra, DynamoDB, or ScyllaDB.
* You have a strong command of distributed system concepts such as replication, partitioning, tunable consistency, and failure recovery.
* You’ve led data modeling efforts for high-throughput, low-latency workloads and understand the real-world trade-offs involved in NoSQL schema design.
* You are experienced with caching technologies like Redis or Memcached and know how to layer them effectively over storage systems to optimize for performance and cost.
* You have a customer-first mindset, and thrive when working closely with product and platform teams to translate complex requirements into clean, scalable data models.
* You are skilled at communicating complex architecture decisions and building alignment across infrastructure and product engineering organizations.
* You have a track record of mentoring engineers, influencing data architecture at scale, and fostering best practices in reliability, observability, and data access patterns.
* You document decisions, share learnings, and take pride in contributing to reusable playbooks and durable frameworks for others to build upon.
* Bonus: You’ve worked on or contributed to open-source distributed databases.

Customer data is the fuel that drives all modern businesses. From product analytics, to marketing, to support, to advertising, advanced data analysis in the warehouse, and even sales – customer data is the raw material for each function at a modern business.
  
  
For highly regulated businesses in healthcare, it’s always been a challenge to harness that customer data and get it to the marketing and analytics tools that require it
*while following patient privacy laws*
….until now.
  
  
Something as simple as running ads to get more users is simple for an e-commerce of software company to do. But common web analytics and advertising tools collect sensitive user identifiers and healthcare information automatically. Those same tools are not HIPAA compliant.
  
  
We provide a layer of data governance to make current web analytics tools HIPAA-compliant. For analytics, our customers can continue getting the insights they need to improve the patient experience. For marketing, Freshpaint safeguards health information while helping our customers promote access to care through popular advertising platforms like Facebook, Google, and others.
  
  
**In short, we help healthcare marketers promote access to care**
***and***
**safeguard patient privacy at the same time.**
This is an important, complex problem in a massive market (healthcare is 20% of the US GDP).
  
  
Our customers manage their customer data with:
  
  

* Privacy Platform. We help healthcare providers automate their website’s + app’s HIPAA compliance, and safeguard patient data. This is our core product today
* Future additional product lines! Our core product provides a platform that we're building marketing applications on top of.

We’re fully remote. If you strongly value in-person work, Freshpaint is likely not the best fit for you. Even though we don’t care where you’re located, we only hire within the US. Many of our team is concentrated in various metro areas like SF or NYC. To balance out our remote-ness, we gather the team 2x times per year for offsites. We’re backed by leading investors including Y-Combinator, Intel Capital, and angel investors like the Head of Data from Slack, Head of Data at LinkedIn, and more.
  
  
Who we are:
  
  
Freshpaint was founded by web analytics veterans who realized how hard it was for highly regulated companies to collect and use customer data in a compliant way. We started as part of Y Combinator’s S19 cohort and have been focused on enabling healthcare companies collect, safeguard, and activate patient data since.
  
  
In 2022 the government issued updated guidance around HIPAA, basically making our software a requirement to use for healthcare companies. As a result, we're one of the fastest growing software companies on earth right now.
  
  
Our team has deep analytics and growth experience, with all of us coming from high-growth companies like Heap, Pendo, Iterable, Quantum Metric, and Retool. If you value lots of freedom and ownership in your work, interfacing with customers, and working on a product with high customer impact, then Freshpaint is your home.
  
  
**In this role you will**

* Own the resolution of assigned customer issues from end to end
* Research, address, and resolve a diverse range of technical customer issues
* Dig into our code base and architecture, understand how we do things, and use that knowledge to guide our customers and resolve issues for them
* Work with Go,TypeScript, and SQL to diagnose and resolve customer issues
* Ensure that our customers receive prompt and effective technical support that meets their needs and exceeds their expectations with a very technically complex product
* Work closely with Engineering, Customer Success, and Account Management teams to provide the best technical support to our customers
* Contribute to comprehensive technical documentation to ensure clarity and accessibility to our customers on how our product works
* Contribute to internal documentation to keep runbooks/procedures up to date and to share knowledge with the team
* Provide expert technical support for the entire life cycle of the customer, from pre-sales/onboarding and on
* Act as the voice of the customer based on your frontline knowledge of customer needs - work alongside Product Managers to define and shape the product goals, roadmap, priorities, and strategy
* Clearly communicate customer issues that require visibility internally and externally in a way that both technical and non-technical teams can understand.

**Requirements - What You’ll Bring**

* Minimum 2 years of experience in a technical role as a support engineer, solutions engineer, software engineer, or similar
* Minimum 2 years of experience in a customer facing role
* Experience with modern programming languages, such as Go or JavaScript - meaning you can write code
* Proficiency in front and back end technologies
* You have a demonstrated ability to research a problem thoroughly and figure things out on your own in order to troubleshoot and resolve technical issues efficiently, but you’re not afraid to ask for help to get the customer what they need.
* Strong communication skills and intuition for communication strategy at every level -- within teams, within the company, and to customers.
* Detail oriented with superior organizational skills -- balancing multiple projects, deadlines, and requests should be second nature to you.
* You have high empathy and care about the customer experience. You can talk to customers and help them resolve their technical issues and assuage any concerns they have with the product.
* You're deeply curious, empathetic, and user-centric, with a knack for sharing customer insights across the rest of the team.
* You get things done – fast. You learn fast and are able to get up to speed quickly on new tools and technologies.. You take ownership and solve problems when you see them.
* You’re not the sort of person who needs to be told what to do - you can figure things out on your own and prioritize ruthlessly when you have a lot of tasks to complete

Perks & Benefits
  
  
We take care of our team—here’s a peek at what you get when you join:
  
  

* Competitive pay + generous equity (10-year exercise window)
* Fully remote (U.S. only) with a $150/month coworking stipend
