At CesiumAstro, we are developers and pioneers of out-of-the-box communication systems for satellites, UAVs, launch vehicles, and other space and airborne platforms. We take pride in our dynamic and cross-functional work environment, which allows us to learn, develop, and engage across our organization. If you are looking for hands-on, interactive, and autonomous work, CesiumAstro is the place for you. We are actively seeking passionate, collaborative, energetic, and forward-thinking individuals to join our team.

We are looking to add a Senior RF Engineering Technician I to our team. If you are excited about working in a startup environment, have a strong work ethic, and are passionate about cutting-edge electronics, we would like to hear from you.

In this position, you will work closely with Cesium engineers to create antenna range and RF test setups, execute test plans, and produce timely, reliable test results.

You will be challenged to propose and fabricate intricate test setups and procedures to increase productivity and improve test results.

Many of our products include active phased arrays. These are antenna products with active RF circuitry integrated with the antenna.

Core day-to-day activities will include aligning with engineers to test and troubleshoot complex electronics and RF circuitry from component level to system level. As such, the ability to understand and work from drawings, diagrams, schematics, and test procedures is key.

As a small company, the Cesium team “wears many hats.” Candidates should be comfortable with a varied workflow that may involve multitasking between test setup creation, test execution, lab organization, and other related tasks.

Job Duties And Responsibilities
• Execute test plans and provide concise and timely reporting of findings
• Organize and maintain antenna testing facilities and resources.
• Support rework of sensitive electronics, including QFNs, chip-scale ICs, RF cables, and 0201 passive components
• Create thorough documentation with meticulous attention to detail and a high standard of quality
• Create clean, intricate, and well-documented test setups consisting of instrumentation, cabling, and the devices under test

Job Requirements And Minimum Qualifications
• An Associate Degree in Electronics Engineering Technology or similar.
• 6 years of experience as an RF technician
• Experience working with active electronics
• Hands-on experience with lab instruments such as network analyzers, spectrum analyzers, and RF signal generators.
• Strong problem-solving skills and ability to troubleshoot complex RF systems
• Strong organization skills
• Comfortable with collaboration tools such as MS Teams, Confluence, and Jira
• Ability to work well under deadlines
• Strong digital, written, and verbal communication skills

Preferred Experience
• Technical degree in Electronics or similar
• 3+ years of related work experience with electronics in aerospace or a related industry
• Hands on experience with active phased array testing
• Experience with RF electronics at 20 GHz or higher
• Familiarity with Python and the ability to read and create simple scripts
• Automating RF and antenna range measurements
• Experience in soldering and assembling RF components and systems

As an authentic, unique, and skilled counselor, you have a plethora of options when it comes to work. Hospitals, community clinics, investment bank funded group practice startups, state agencies, and more. At OptiMindHealth, we continuously strive to provide consistent, high-quality care and expand the reach of mental health care services in our communities. Unfortunately, the need often outpaces the services available to those we serve and only adds to the current mental health crisis in our nation. To combat this crisis and further our mission, we need more compassionate and skilled clinicians to join our cause. We are not interested in the ""burnt-out"" clinician that no longer finds meaning in their work and is just going through the motions; we are seeking people with a passion to provide excellent care, and the belief that we, together, can make a difference. If that's you, then you're in the right place! Our approach with our team is simple, we take care of you, the clinician, so you can take care of patients. How do we do that? By investing in your growth, supporting you financially, holistically, and professionally, while being flexible regarding your personal needs and goals. The work we do with patients is hard enough and over the years we have found that our team often does their best work when the administrative burdens are taken off their plate and they are able to be fully present with their patients. Our administrative support team handles all non-clinical tasks so that you don't have to think about anything except focusing on your patients. Why bother with the endless administrative burdens and isolation of private practice? Use your highly trained interpersonal skills to change the culture around mental health care, decrease stigma, and help people who need you, while being supported by an experienced multi-disciplinary team of clinicians. Let us take care of the rest! Want to work part time? No problem. Want to do group therapy? Sure! Want to do long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy with all of your clients? We do it every day. Interested in treating couples? We can make that happen. Basically, what we are saying is that whatever outpatient care you are interested in providing, we can surely accommodate you. We know you have exceptional skills; we want you to be part of our team. The perfect candidate will share our passion for improving and expanding access to high quality mental health care and will thrive in a culture that emphasizes creativity, authenticity, humor, compassion, acceptance, and determination. Telehealth or onsite, we support your authentic and unique growth trajectory, while being yourself and having some fun! We prioritize the clinician's experience by offering excellent compensation, benefits, training/supervision, and flexibility. Whether you're working from home or in one of our physical offices, if you're doing it during your scheduled work hours, you're getting paid for it. Our compensation packages include: Starting Salary range: $62,000.00 - $80,000.00 per year. 401K with maximum employee matching. Health care benefits. Generous paid vacation and sick leave time. Paid administrative time for consultation, supervision, and documentation. Full administrative support. Here are a few extra perks our team loves: Paid supervision, clinical rounds, and administrative time. Customized schedules within available clinic hours. Hybrid work environment if desired: Telehealth and/or in-person (in select locations). Muti-disciplinary team approach to treatment. Incredible administrative support team. Company leadership that understands the practice of mental healthcare. Inclusive, socially responsible, client focused leadership. We are not a franchise or a big investor-backed company. And most importantly, clinician-led and clinician-FOCUSED! We know what it's like to work in an organization led by businesspeople instead of clinicians. We, on the other hand, have organically grown as a socially responsible company that started as a single provider on a mission to destigmatize and broaden the reach of mental health care, to an integrated and holistic group of exceptional providers with diverse backgrounds working toward that mission. We are fortunate to have significantly increased the reach of mental health care services in our communities, and look forward to continuing to provide consistent, high-quality care to those we serve for many years to come. We will rely on your expertise to: Evaluate mental health conditions, diagnose, create, and implement a treatment plan, complete ongoing documentation including further diagnosis, treatment plan reviews, and case notes according to company policy. Provide excellent care for clients and collaborate with a dynamic team to further the mission of filling gaps in our community. Utilize creativity in interventions to help clients achieve and exceed goals. Prepare and submit individual documentation for each session per company guidelines and protocol. For Full-Time status, clinicians must maintain at least 32 available hours for patient care per week. Coordinate services with other care providers, families, work personnel, medical personnel, other OptiMindHealth staff, and school staff as needed. Attend and participate in all clinical staff meetings and trainings. Qualifications and Skill for This Positions: Master's degree in one of the behavioral sciences or related fields from an accredited college/university. Full, current, unrestricted license to practice independently (LPC, LCSW, LMFT) is required. Experience with electronic health records and completing clinical documentation. Effective written and verbal communication skills. Experience and willingness to work collaboratively and creatively to meet necessary deadlines. Comfort and familiarity working with clients with a diverse range of problems or concerns. Ability to pass a background check in a way that confirms to us you can provide safe care. Demonstrate and model stable and appropriate boundaries with clients. Additionally Valuable (but not essential) Qualifications for This Position: Experience working in community, group, or private practice mental health. Currently paneled or credentialed with insurance network. Multilingual or bilingual proficiency. Specialty area of practice. We can't wait to hear your story and look forward to sharing ours!

**ABOUT THE COMPANY**

Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.

In 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills.

Although we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.

Our customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose Republic Services because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.

Our company values guide our daily actions:

* **Safe**: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities.
* **Committed to Serve**: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations.
* **Environmentally Responsible:** We take action to improve our environment.
* **Driven**: We deliver results in the right way.
* **Human-Centered:** We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.

We are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.

**STRATEGY**

Republic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.

We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.

With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.

**Recycling and Waste**

We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.

**Environmental Solutions**

Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.

**SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION**

Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.

The Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.

We continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.
