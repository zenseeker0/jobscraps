Vanta has a kind and talented team, and while some have prior security experience, many have been successful at Vanta without it.

Vanta is the leading trust management platform that helps businesses secure their digital environments and simplify compliance. Hundreds of companies rely on Vanta to automate security and compliance workflows, achieve certifications like SOC 2, ISO 27001, CMMC, and HIPAA, and build trust with customers.

Vanta is looking for a Vanta for Government (V4G) Account Executive to drive the adoption of compliance automation and risk management solutions tailored for government contractors and agencies. Public-sector buyers have stringent, evolving requirements that demand both sales excellence and deep regulatory fluency. You will be the federal-framework authority who partners with core AEs as an overlayrep ( 70 % overlay / 30 % direct) to unlock, advance and close CMMC/FedRAMP/NIST opportunities that the broader team can’t tackle alone. You will influence product and compliance strategy and have the opportunity to directly close deals.

**What You’ll Do:**

* **Act as a subject matter expert (SME)** on federal compliance frameworks including CMMC, FedRAMP, StateRAMP, ITAR, and NIST 800-171, guiding internal AEs through complex sales cycles and objections.
* **Support core AEs in live deals** as an overlay rep, bringing specialized knowledge to help advance and close federal-focused opportunities.
* **Support enablement across the sales org** by creating playbooks, delivering training, and developing resources that raise the team’s federal selling competency.
* **Own full-cycle sales for select opportunities**, particularly with prime contractors and buyers that fall outside core AE reach or require deep compliance expertise.
* **Drive pipeline generation** through targeted outbound efforts, industry events, partnerships with SIs and 3PAOs, and tailored messaging for public sector buyers.
* **Provide real-time feedback to Product & Engineering**, informing roadmap priorities related to Vanta’s V4G offering, including inherited controls for FedRAMP Moderate/High.
* **Collaborate with RevOps and Sales Ops** to forecast accurately and maintain clean, actionable CRM data for public sector opportunities.

**What We’re Looking For:**

* 5+ years of experience selling software solutions, preferably SaaS, to government agencies or government contractors.
* Strong understanding of compliance frameworks relevant to public sector procurement, such as FedRAMP, CMMC, ITAR, and NIST 800-171.
* Proven ability to navigate complex procurement cycles, including responding to RFPs, managing government contract vehicles, and working with government buyers.
* Established relationships with key procurement and compliance stakeholders across government agencies, system integrators, and industry vendors.
* Expertise in outbound prospecting and crafting messaging tailored for public sector buyers.
* Comfortable operating in a fast-paced, high-growth environment with evolving priorities.

**Why Join Us?**

* Be a pioneer: This is one of Vanta’s highest-priority growth segments, with strong executive support and investment.
* Unique expertise: Public sector sales is a high-skill function. This role offers a strategic sales challenge with lucrative deal sizes and long-term customer relationships.
* High earning potential: Public sector solutions - across government and the government vendor sector - often involve high-figure, multi-year deals.
* Shape the future: The team will define Vanta’s go-to-market strategy for public sector trust management, working closely with leadership.

**What you can expect as a Vantan:**

* Industry-competitive compensation
* 100% covered medical, dental, and vision benefits with dependents coverage

### **Role Summary**

The Chief of Staff to SVP, Strategy & Ops is a strategic partner and force multiplier, enabling high-leverage execution across Mozilla Corporation’s growth-critical domains: strategy, monetization, data, advertising, customer experience, trust & safety, and business operations. This senior role is central to driving coherence, speed, and impact across MoCo’s most pivotal cross-functional initiatives.

This is a builder-operator role for someone who can architect operating models, drive executive forums, and embed accountability frameworks—while also getting hands-on to resolve bottlenecks and deliver outcomes.

This role is distinct from Mozilla.org’s portfolio-level Chief of Staff and is designed for a proven leader ready to help steward the organization’s role in Mozilla’s transformation and deliver execution excellence in a rapidly evolving business.

### **Key Responsibilities**

#### **1. Strategic Program Leadership**

* Lead or co-lead cross-functional, high-impact initiatives within Mozilla Corporation (e.g., optimization projects, AI integration initiatives).
* Operationalize strategic imperatives into workstreams with timelines, clear milestones, and cross-org accountability structures.
* Resolve cross-functional ambiguity and execution misalignment by coordinating with the SVP’s senior leadership team and other MoCo execs.

#### **2. Team Operating Model & Governance**

* Design and evolve the operating rhythm for Strategy & Ops: QBRs, offsites, leadership forums, and cross-functional check-ins.
* Ensure Strategy & Ops priorities are integrated into MoCo-level strategic planning, execution dashboards, and board-level communications.
* Maintain shared operating artifacts like team-wide scorecards, authority matrices, initiative tracking, and milestone reviews.

#### **3. Cross-Org Collaboration & Communication**

* Serve as the connective tissue between Strategy & Ops teams (includes: Strategy, Monetization teams, Ops, Data, Ads Product & Eng) and peer organizations across MoCo.
* Lead the coordination and content development for strategic planning inputs, OKRs, investment proposals, and executive narratives.
* Support org-wide storytelling by drafting SVP communications and presentation materials.

#### **4. Decision Support & SVP Leverage**

* Act as a strategic advisor and counsel to the SVP—helping prioritize time, decision-making focus, and organizational attention.
* Drive clarity, structure, and action in ambiguous or emergent strategic opportunities.
* Represent the SVP in meetings and working groups when needed, ensuring progress continues without introducing friction or overhead.

#### **5. Org Effectiveness & Culture Enablement**

* Champion operating efficiency, working to “lift the load” across SODA teams by identifying redundant processes and unlocking execution velocity.
* Role-model Mozilla’s culture of mission-first, high-trust, low-ego collaboration—driving cross-team accountability and alignment without drama.
* Act as a cultural barometer — surfacing emerging team dynamics, spotting where clarity or support is needed, and helping the SVP calibrate leadership energy/focus as the team expands its remit and internal influence.

### **What You Bring**

#### **Experience**

* **12+ years** of experience in business operations, strategic program management, or Chief of Staff roles, preferably within product-led or mission-driven tech companies.
* Experience running executive-level operations or complex programs involving multiple functions (e.g., strategy, marketing, product, data).
* Proven success managing high-visibility initiatives in ambiguous, evolving org environments.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.
* **Human-Centered Thinking**: You put learners at the center, designing for relevance, accessibility, and behavioral impact.

**Position Summary**
--------------------

HackerOne is seeking a Senior Deal Desk Manager to join our FP&A team, focused on evaluating and supporting complex Enterprise and Channel deals. This role serves as a key business partner to Sales, Legal, and Finance, providing financial insight, deal-level analysis, and forecasting support to ensure alignment with our strategic and financial goals. You will play a central role in understanding how large-scale, customized deals impact our topline and margin performance, and help operationalize pricing and deal structure discipline across both direct and indirect sales motions.

You’ll bring structured insight into both Enterprise sales motions (multi-year, high-touch, bespoke terms) and Channel strategy (partner-led, co-sell, resale, distribution), helping the business scale with clarity and control.

Reporting to our VP, Strategic Finance, you’ll operate at the intersection of pricing, forecasting, and go-to-market strategy—ensuring that every major deal supports both short-term goals and long-term growth.

At HackerOne, we embrace a Flexible Work approach, enabling our team members to work remotely while maintaining productivity and collaboration. We are seeking candidates located in **Austin, TX or Washington, DC**, and the surrounding metropolitan areas, to facilitate occasional in-person interactions as needed.

This approach ensures flexibility while providing opportunities to build meaningful in-person relationships that strengthen our team and company culture.

**What You Will Do**
--------------------

* Partner with Sales, Legal, and Finance to support Enterprise and Channel deals, providing analysis and guidance on deal structure, margin impact, and overall financial health.
* Build financial models and scenario analyses to assess the impact of large, non-standard deals and channel partner agreements on bookings, ARR, and profitability.
* Act as a trusted advisor during the deal review and approval process, ensuring financial guardrails and pricing strategies are upheld across regions and segments.
* Support FP&A in improving forecast accuracy by integrating near-term deal activity into pipeline, bookings, and revenue projections.
* Track and report on deal-related KPIs such as average deal size, discount trends, sales cycle time, partner margins, and direct vs. indirect performance.
* Bring structured insight into Enterprise sales motion (multi-year, high-touch, bespoke terms) and Channel strategy (partner-led, co-sell, resale, distribution).
* Contribute to pricing strategy reviews and collaborate with the broader finance and go-to-market teams to refine packaging and discounting frameworks.
* Bring a solution-oriented mindset to complex deal scenarios — identifying trade-offs and proposing creative structures that balance financial discipline with business enablement.
* Participate in quarter-end performance analysis and planning cycles, helping to explain deal-driven variance to plan.
* Develop and deliver reporting that helps leadership make informed decisions about large deals, channel programs, and revenue predictability.

**Minimum Qualifications**
--------------------------

* 8+ years of experience in FP&A, Deal Desk, Strategic Finance, or Sales Strategy roles, ideally in tech/SaaS environments.
* Strong expertise in enterprise deal structures, complex pricing terms, and SaaS business models.
* Deep understanding of SaaS metrics and the financial implications of complex pricing, custom terms, and partner economics.
* Strong financial modeling skills and ability to translate data into actionable business insights.
* Experience partnering cross-functionally with Sales, Legal, and Executive leadership.
* Proven success in high-growth environments, with a track record of scaling financial processes and operational workflows to drive efficiency and support rapid expansion.
* Clear communicator with a strong ability to influence decisions in fast-paced, high-growth environments.
* Proficiency in Salesforce and familiarity with planning/BI tools like Adaptive Insights, Looker, or Tableau.

With over 2,200 dealerships on our platform and 5x growth since 2020, we’re not just keeping up with the industry – we’re redefining it.  
  
As the first Augmented Intelligence CRM in automotive, we pair intuitive design with smart automation to make complex processes feel easy. And because we’re certified by major OEMs and integrate with every major DMS, we fit seamlessly into the way dealerships work. No clunky bolt-ons, just results.  
  
We’re a team that moves fast, solves real problems, and believes better software drives better results.  
  
**Role Overview**  
We’re looking for a Product Marketing Manager who knows how to turn features into firepower for the sales team. You’ll help lead the charge on go-to-market strategy, competitive positioning, and enablement tools that help us win against the big names in automotive CRM.  
  
This is a role built for a sharp, driven marketer with 4–6 years of experience who loves diving into the “why it matters” behind every product release. You’ll work across Product, Sales, and Marketing to dig into the market, sharpen our value prop, and craft messaging that actually resonates with GMs, dealer principals, and sales managers.  
  
You’ll own everything from launch plans and persona insights to battlecards, pitch decks, and one-pagers—giving our sales team the tools they need to stand out and close strong. If you’ve got a knack for storytelling, a love for competition, and the drive to help dealers succeed, you’ll fit right in.  
  
**What You’ll Own**

* Keep enablement materials fresh and field-tested—updating content as products evolve and feedback rolls in.

Content & Campaign Support

* Bring the product story to life across content formats—webinars, blog posts, case studies, and more.
* Align closely with the marketing team to ensure product messaging is clear, consistent, and driving engagement across every channel
* Use data (from HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.) to track performance and optimize what’s working—so we’re always leveling up.

**What We’re Looking For**

* 4+ years in marketing or product marketing, with a strong portfolio of messaging, positioning, and sales tools that drive results.
* Experience in the automotive space is a must—bonus if you’ve worked with or sold into dealerships, or supported automotive CRM or retail tech.
* Sharp eye for competition—able to break down what others are doing and clearly define why we’re better.
* You know how to turn features into dealer-friendly benefits, making complex ideas easy to understand and sell.
* Strong communicator—whether you’re writing a one-pager, leading a sales training, or presenting to leadership.
* Hands-on with tools like Salesforce and HubSpot, and comfortable using data to guide messaging and strategy.
* Organized, deadline-driven, and experienced juggling multiple projects across teams without missing a beat.
* Bachelor’s degree in Marketing, Business, Communications, or equivalent experience—we care more about what you’ve done than just what’s on paper.

**What It’s Like to Work Here**  
At DriveCentric, we move fast, think big, and put dealers first. Our culture is built on four core values: Exceptional, Visionary, Effortless, and Rewarding. Which means we aim high, keep things simple, and make sure our customers (and teammates) always see the value.  
  
We’re a team that collaborates hard, laughs often, and brings new ideas to life daily. Everyone here has a voice, and we celebrate initiative, creativity, and impact. If you like solving real problems, thinking a few steps ahead, and having fun while doing it, you’ll fit right in.

Product Managers ensure that products are fulfilling their primary purpose to enable users to perform tasks that create value for the company. Product managers have two broad areas of responsibility:

* Setting strategic vision for the product to ensure the customer and their needs are at the center; and ensuring team priorities are supporting business outcomes for customer, product, technical and enabling teams. This requires continual alignment of the product strategy and objectives with customer, product, technical, and enabling teams and managing the product backlog, which prioritizes the work of the assigned squads, to achieve the vision and aligned strategy.

* To successfully manage these areas of responsibility, product managers must have a deep understanding of the product domain, related technology, and architecture. Enterprise Product Managers drive strategy and execution for a complex ecosystem of digital products that cross multiple workflows, technical platforms, and business units.

**YOUR TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES**

The primary responsibilities of this role, Enterprise Product Manager are to:

Product Management

* The product manager is accountable for the overall success of a product throughout its lifecycle, from conception to decommissioning. They identify domain needs, develop, and validate product concepts, and build a business case. They oversee the product's build and launch, including any sourced services; as well as ensure product availability, stability, and compliance needs are met. Product managers collaborate with various teams, including product development, marketing, finance, legal, manufacturing, operations, and sales, as needed, to ensure cohesive progress and success.

* Product Managers drive agile best practices with the team to improve delivery, including continuous planning ahead of each development cycle (e.g. sprint planning) and working together to co-create user stories aligned with the product backlog prioritization. In addition to guiding the team product managers have duties like market opportunity identification, competitive analysis, sales enablement, or monitoring domain performance.

Stakeholder Engagement

* It is vital for the product manager to identify their key stakeholder group. Though many strong and loud opinions will be expressed, an effective product manager uses discretion to deliver their product in a way that meets the needs of users and stakeholders who will ensure value is realized for Bayer. Stakeholders should trust that the product manager not only understands their needs but will actively work to ensure their needs are met while delivering the product.

Product Strategy

THE JOB

We are looking for a Senior AI-Driven Platform Automation Engineer to join our high-impact Platform Automation and SRE group within the Core Concerts division at Ticketmaster.

You’ll contribute hands-on code, create scalable automation, and guide the adoption of AI-driven software development patterns that enable the team to move faster and build smarter. This is a unique opportunity to shape how a lean, high-leverage engineering team uses automation and AI to deliver real impact.

WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING

Software Engineering & Automation

* Write high-quality, maintainable code to accelerate platform automation and reduce tech debt across Core Concerts systems.
* Use scripting (Python, Bash, etc.) and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Ansible, etc.) to simplify operational workflows.
* Lead technical deep-dives to identify automation opportunities and tackle long-standing inefficiencies.

AI-Driven Development

* Drive adoption of AI developer tools like GitHub Copilot, Ollama, Amazon Q, etc. across the team.
* Champion the use of agentic AI systems that plan, reason, and act—building frameworks that enable autonomous task execution and tool chaining.
Help define and evolve our internal patterns for LLM-backed development and AI-augmented refactoring workflows.  

Team Enablement & Standards

* Help define and evangelize internal standards for platform automation, SRE practices, and code quality.
* Mentor engineers and share knowledge across the team—especially in accelerating output using modern AI tooling.
* Collaborate closely with reliability and platform engineers to deliver automation that sticks—measurable impact over buzzwords.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW (or TECHNICAL SKILLS)

* Strong knowledge of at least one scripting language (Python, Bash) and exposure to infrastructure tooling (e.g., Terraform, CI/CD pipelines).
* Experience with automated VM deployments (VMware) and automated configuration management (Ansible).
* Experience in SRE, DevOps, or platform engineering environments—or the curiosity to quickly ramp up in that domain.
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills; you enjoy being a multiplier.

**Our company culture:** Our talented employees — or athenistas, as we call ourselves — spark the innovation and passion needed to accomplish our vision. We are a diverse group of dreamers and do-ers with unique knowledge, expertise, backgrounds, and perspectives. We unite as mission-driven problem-solvers with a deep desire to achieve our vision and make our time here count. Our award-winning culture is built around shared values of inclusiveness, accountability, and support.

About athenahealth
  
  
**Our vision:** In an industry that becomes more complex by the day, we stand for simplicity. We offer IT solutions and expert services that eliminate the daily hurdles preventing healthcare providers from focusing entirely on their patients — powered by our vision to create a thriving ecosystem that delivers accessible, high-quality, and sustainable healthcare for all.
  
  
**Our company culture:** Our talented employees — or athenistas, as we call ourselves — spark the innovation and passion needed to accomplish our vision. We are a diverse group of dreamers and do-ers with unique knowledge, expertise, backgrounds, and perspectives. We unite as mission-driven problem-solvers with a deep desire to achieve our vision and make our time here count. Our award-winning culture is built around shared values of inclusiveness, accountability, and support.
  
  
**Our DEI commitment:** Our vision of accessible, high-quality, and sustainable healthcare for all requires addressing the inequities that stand in the way. That's one reason we prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion in every aspect of our business, from attracting and sustaining a diverse workforce to maintaining an inclusive environment for athenistas, our partners, customers and the communities where we work and serve.
  
  
**What we can do for you:**  
Along with health and financial benefits, athenistas enjoy perks specific to each location, including commuter support, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, employee resource groups, and collaborative workspaces — some offices even welcome dogs.
  
  
We also encourage a better work-life balance for athenistas with our flexibility. While we know in-office collaboration is critical to our vision, we recognize that not all work needs to be done within an office environment, full-time. With consistent communication and digital collaboration tools, athenahealth enables employees to find a balance that feels fulfilling and productive for each individual situation.
  
  
In addition to our traditional benefits and perks, we sponsor events throughout the year, including book clubs, external speakers, and hackathons. We provide athenistas with a company culture based on learning, the support of an engaged team, and an inclusive environment where all employees are valued.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.

* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.

In this pivotal leadership role, you will partner directly with clients and cross-functional teams to reimagine how learning fuels business strategy in an AI-powered world.

You won’t just create learning programs—you’ll engineer the future of capability enablement, infusing it with GenAI, immersive tech, real-time skills intelligence, and adaptive frameworks to power workforce transformation at scale.

**Your Impact**

As the **Business Interlock****Manager**, you'll serve as the strategic architect and experience designer for learning interventions that enable rapid upskilling, behavior change, and long-term growth. You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**What You’ll Lead**

**Learning Strategy**

* Develop future-fit learning strategies grounded in business priorities, workforce trends, and the evolving skills landscape.
* Design learning pathways that guide learners across proficiency levels, supported by modern frameworks, digital ecosystems, and on-demand technologies.
* Leverage tools like talent intelligence platforms, AI-enabled L&D diagnostics, and predictive workforce planning to shape learning roadmaps.

**Curriculum Innovation, Planning & Solutioning**

* Proactively engage with business stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points, and emerging capability needs.
* Translate business drivers into bold learning solutions by recommending the most impactful learning architectures, modalities, and experiences.
* Curate and integrate learning assets from internal and external sources to build dynamic, role-based learning ecosystems.
* Develop and document solution requirements via Preliminary Learning Briefs (PLBs) or executive-ready summary decks.
* Review and map source content to skill frameworks and performance goals—identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation.
* Define and iterate on initial scope, budget, and resource models, leveraging data to optimize speed, scale, and impact while closing skill gaps, enabling business agility, and empowering people to grow.
* Generate and negotiate multiple solution pathways, tailoring the approach to learner needs, tech readiness, and business goals.

* Craft transformative learning solutions that blend storytelling, science, and smart technology (e.g., VR, adaptive learning, scenario-based simulations).
* Maintain curriculum relevance through continuous content optimization, performance data insights, and learner feedback loops.

**Strategic Demand & Pipeline Planning**

* Partner with clients and business sponsors to map out 30/60/90-day learning demand, scope, and timelines with agility and foresight.
* Manage resource allocations and staffing projections, ensuring the right capabilities are in place to deliver at speed and scale.
* Continuously assess the development pipeline, balancing capacity with innovation potential.

**Stakeholder Influence & Advisory**

* Act as a trusted advisor and strategic partner, helping stakeholders navigate complexity and align learning with organizational outcomes.
* Guide clients through the design-to-deploy journey, building consensus, addressing friction points, and unlocking new value.
* Use data storytelling to enable decision-making, highlight performance trends, and advocate for ongoing investment in learning.

**Operational Excellence**

* Partner with the Learning Studio Lead on goals, deliverables, timelines and dependencies to execute projects (e.g. staffing, onboarding, team engagement) across the full lifecycle—design, build, deploy, measure.
* Define KPIs tied to business outcomes and develop robust evaluation frameworks that assess learning impact using behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative data.
* Champion lean operating models that emphasize continuous improvement, reusability, and intelligent automation.

**What You Bring**

* **Strategic Intelligence**: You see the bigger picture and understand how learning drives transformation, not just training.
* **Digital Fluency**: You're fluent in the tools, tech, and trends (GenAI, LLMs, VR, nudging, microlearning) shaping the future of work and learning.
* **Programmatic Agility**: You can scale from executive vision to executional precision with a sharp eye on time, budget, and quality.

You’ll operate as both thought leader and execution partner, guiding Learning Studio teams to deliver bold, measurable outcomes across a dynamic development pipeline of Academies, solutions, and enterprise programs.

This is a high-influence, high-visibility role for a leader who is equal parts visionary, builder, and operator.

**Operational Excellence**

**Senior Deal Desk Manager**
----------------------------

**Remote Location: Austin, TX or Washington, DC**
-------------------------------------------------

**Position Summary**
--------------------

HackerOne is seeking a Senior Deal Desk Manager to join our FP&A team, focused on evaluating and supporting complex Enterprise and Channel deals. This role serves as a key business partner to Sales, Legal, and Finance, providing financial insight, deal-level analysis, and forecasting support to ensure alignment with our strategic and financial goals. You will play a central role in understanding how large-scale, customized deals impact our topline and margin performance, and help operationalize pricing and deal structure discipline across both direct and indirect sales motions.

You’ll bring structured insight into both Enterprise sales motions (multi-year, high-touch, bespoke terms) and Channel strategy (partner-led, co-sell, resale, distribution), helping the business scale with clarity and control.

Reporting to our VP, Strategic Finance, you’ll operate at the intersection of pricing, forecasting, and go-to-market strategy—ensuring that every major deal supports both short-term goals and long-term growth.

At HackerOne, we embrace a Flexible Work approach, enabling our team members to work remotely while maintaining productivity and collaboration. We are seeking candidates located in **Austin, TX or Washington, DC**, and the surrounding metropolitan areas, to facilitate occasional in-person interactions as needed. While the position is primarily remote, there will be periodic in-person requirements to support team collaboration and foster stronger connections. This approach ensures flexibility while providing opportunities to build meaningful in-person relationships that strengthen our team and company culture.

**What You Will Do**
--------------------

* Partner with Sales, Legal, and Finance to support Enterprise and Channel deals, providing analysis and guidance on deal structure, margin impact, and overall financial health.
* Build financial models and scenario analyses to assess the impact of large, non-standard deals and channel partner agreements on bookings, ARR, and profitability.
* Act as a trusted advisor during the deal review and approval process, ensuring financial guardrails and pricing strategies are upheld across regions and segments.
* Support FP&A in improving forecast accuracy by integrating near-term deal activity into pipeline, bookings, and revenue projections.
* Track and report on deal-related KPIs such as average deal size, discount trends, sales cycle time, partner margins, and direct vs. indirect performance.
* Bring structured insight into Enterprise sales motion (multi-year, high-touch, bespoke terms) and Channel strategy (partner-led, co-sell, resale, distribution).
* Contribute to pricing strategy reviews and collaborate with the broader finance and go-to-market teams to refine packaging and discounting frameworks.
* Bring a solution-oriented mindset to complex deal scenarios — identifying trade-offs and proposing creative structures that balance financial discipline with business enablement.
* Participate in quarter-end performance analysis and planning cycles, helping to explain deal-driven variance to plan.
* Develop and deliver reporting that helps leadership make informed decisions about large deals, channel programs, and revenue predictability.

**Minimum Qualifications**
--------------------------

* 8+ years of experience in FP&A, Deal Desk, Strategic Finance, or Sales Strategy roles, ideally in tech/SaaS environments.
* Strong expertise in enterprise deal structures, complex pricing terms, and SaaS business models.
* Deep understanding of SaaS metrics and the financial implications of complex pricing, custom terms, and partner economics.
* Strong financial modeling skills and ability to translate data into actionable business insights.

Why Figment?**
  

**Figment**
powers the future of Web3 through industry-leading blockchain infrastructure. As the leading provider of staking solutions,
**we help 500+ institutional clients optimize their crypto rewards**
, including top exchanges, asset managers, wallets, foundations, custodians, and major token holders. Our clients trust Figment for a comprehensive suite of services, including
**reward optimization**
,
**cutting-edge API development**
, detailed
**rewards reporting**
, seamless
**partner integrations**
,
**governance support**
, and
**slashing protection**
.

  

Backed by a team of passionate and intelligent Figmates, with a
**100% remote-first**
global presence across
**12 countries**
, our company is on a mission to accelerate the adoption, growth, and long-term success of the Web3 ecosystem. We’re building the infrastructure that will power the decentralized future.

  

As a fast-growing tech company, we’re looking for
**builders**
and
**innovators**
— people who thrive in the face of uncertainty and are motivated to make an impact. We are also looking for true teammates - people who are genuine, humble, and driven to level up together. If you're excited to shape the future, contribute to an
**energetic company culture**
, and work at the cutting edge of blockchain technology, we want you to join our team and help us lead the charge!

**About the opportunity**
  

We’re looking for a
**Director of Product Marketing - Sales Enablement**
who deeply understands the institutional digital asset space — especially staking — and can craft compelling narratives that showcase Figment’s differentiation with institutional audiences globally.

  

This is not your average Director of Product Marketing role. Yes, we need strong messaging, positioning, and go-to-market support. But above all, we’re looking for a clear thinker and exceptional messenger in a rapidly evolving category who can:

  

  
* Break down complex product concepts and differentiators into crisp, buyer-relevant messaging
  
* Mine customer questions and Buyer Group insights and turn them efficiently into scalable GTM materials at the pace of digital asset staking’s rapid growth
  
* Write sales pitches that resonate with financial institutions and respect a highly and rapidly evolving regulatory environment
  
* Surface and uniquely package the value of Figment’s People, Products and Performance
  
* Help our sales team and customers understand Figment’s product and protocol roadmap
  

  

You’ve been a sales engineer, technical marketer, or product-oriented pitch creator in crypto, and you know what institutions care about.

  

This role will have three direct reports: Protocol Marketing lead, Marketing Operations Coordinator, and Product Marketing Manager - Sales Enablement (APAC).

  
**How you will make an impact**
  

**Positioning & Messaging**

  

  
* Develop differentiated messaging and clear value propositions for our staking infrastructure
  
* Articulate how Figment stands out from other staking providers in terms of compliance, security, architecture, and track record
  
* Create product narratives tailored to specific Buyer Groups (e.g. custodians, exchanges, asset managers)
  

  

**Sales Enablement**

  

  
* Write compelling pitch decks and sales collateral for new and existing product offerings
  
* Partner with Sales and RevOps to understand what resonates, where we win/lose, and where messaging needs to evolve
  
* Work closely with the central Partner Marketing team and key partners (e.g., exchanges, custodians, institutional players) to create joint marketing materials (sales enablement), case studies, and co-branded campaigns.
  

  

**Go-to-Market Support**

  

  
* Own launch messaging and positioning for new protocols and products
  
* Support campaign and event programming with key inputs: target audiences, key messages, content briefs
  
* Partner across teams to ensure alignment across all channels
  

  

**Product Architecture & Clarity**

  

  
* Work with Product, Protocol, and Engineering teams to translate technical updates into externally facing clarity: What changed? Why does it matter? Who cares?
  
* Maintain clear public documentation and up-to-date messaging as Buyer Groups, protocols and features evolve – and clear product architecture
  

  
**What you bring to the team**
  

  
* 7+ years of experience in product marketing, technical marketing, or sales engineering — ideally in crypto, fintech, or infrastructure with at least 5 years in a leadership role
  
* Deep understanding of staking, validators, and the broader crypto ecosystem
  
* Exceptional writing skills — able to create clean, clear, compelling content for technical and business audiences
  
* Experience working with institutional customers and/or regulated markets
  
* A proactive, curious mindset and the ability to translate complexity into simplicity
  
* Comfort working cross-functionally across Product, Sales, Marketing, and Protocol teams
  

  
**Nice to have**
  

  
* Experience with launches, positioning strategy, and value-based storytelling
  
* Experience managing a team, ideally globally
  

  
**Technologies we use**
  

Google Suite, Notion, Canva

  
**Teams you’ll collaborate with most often**
  

In addition to collaborating with other Marketing team members, this role will collaborate most often with our Sales, Sales Engineering, Protocol, Product, and Business Development teams.
