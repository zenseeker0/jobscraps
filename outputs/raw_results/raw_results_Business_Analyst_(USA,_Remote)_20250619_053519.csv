CyberArk is seeking a Senior Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst with a passion for sales strategy and business insight to join our Business Analytics team.

You’ll play a key role in shaping how performance is measured, understood, and improved across our global go-to-market (GTM) organization. While you’ll contribute to dashboard development and scalable reporting in Tableau, this role goes far beyond building reports—you’ll be expected to uncover trends, connect dots across complex datasets, and communicate insights in a way that resonates with non-technical audiences. The ideal candidate is a business-minded analyst with strong sales acumen, excellent communication skills, and an instinct for asking the right questions to get to the heart of the problem.

**Responsibilities:**

* Serve as an embedded analytics partner to global Sales and Sales Operations stakeholders, proactively identifying opportunities to improve pipeline, productivity, and conversion
* Craft clear, executive-ready narratives based on deep-dive analyses of sales performance, pipeline coverage, segmentation, and revenue trends
* Translate complex data and technical concepts into actionable recommendations that are easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand and act upon
* Design and evolve self-service dashboards and tools in Tableau that reduce friction and enable faster time-to-decision
* Maintain a high bar for data accuracy and consistency across reports and ad hoc deliverables

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

* You enjoy working behind the scenes to make processes run better and faster.

  

#### **Qualifications**

* Bachelor’s degree in Business, Finance, Economics, or another analytical or operational discipline.
* 1–3 years of experience in operations, business analysis, investor support, capital markets, or a related function.
