**Our Approach to Flexible Work**
With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply
**spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field**
with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
  
  
Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

**Job Summary**
The Computer Science Department and the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Impact Lab (ESIIL) within CIRES at the University of Colorado Boulder welcome applications for a Post-Doctoral Research Scholar in Machine Learning (ML) and/or Artificial Intelligence (AI) with connection to the field of Environmental Data Science (EDS).
  
  
This is an interdisciplinary fellowship aimed at strengthening the connection between core research in ML/AI and EDS. The postdoctoral fellow will have the support and network of the vibrant Computer Science and ESIIL communities at CU Boulder. The postdoctoral fellow will be advised by Professor Esther Rolf (primary mentor), Professor Claire Monteleoni in the Computer Science Department, and an additional mentor in environmental science at ESIIL. The specific mentor(s) in ESIIL will depend on the postdoctoral fellow’s research interests. Potential connections to ESIIL are broad (see the ESIIL research team website) and could include for example, AI/ML methods to better estimate biomass, land cover or vegetation community composition or structure in connection to ecosystem change or ecological transformations.
  
  
CU is an Equal Opportunity Employer and complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment. We are committed to creating a workplace where all individuals are treated with respect and dignity, and we encourage individuals from all backgrounds to apply, including protected veterans and individuals with disabilities.
  
  
**Who We Are**
**Machine Learning for the Environment at CU Boulder CS:**
This postdoctoral fellow will be advised by Professors Esther Rolf and Claire Monteleoni in the Computer Science Department. Professor Rolf’s lab specializes in geospatial and statistical machine learning. Her research group develops computationally efficient models and algorithms tailored to geospatial machine learning with remotely sensed data and analyzes how the representativeness of training and pre-training datasets influences the accuracy and applicability of machine learning systems across global regions and populations. Professor Monteleoni is the AI/ML Lead for the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). Her research group, Climate & Machine Learning Boulder (CLIMB ), develops machine learning approaches to confronting climate change at a variety of time-scales.
  
  
**About ESIIL:**
The postdoctoral fellow will also have an advisor in the Environmental Data Science Innovation & Impact Lab (ESIIL) , an NSF-funded data synthesis center led by the University of Colorado Boulder in collaboration with NSF’s CyVerse at the University of Arizona and the University of Oslo. ESIIL’s mission is to empower a broad community to accelerate open Environmental Data Science. ESIIL is part of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at CU Boulder and enables a global community of environmental data scientists to leverage the wealth of environmental data and emerging analytics to develop science-based solutions to solve pressing challenges in environmental sciences. ESIIL’s research community generates discoveries and novel approaches through 1) cutting-edge team science, 2) innovative tools and collaborative cyberinfrastructures, 3) data-science education and training, and 4) building broad collaborations and networks. These activities advance the frontier of environmental data science, a rapidly evolving discipline bridging the computational, biological, environmental, and social sciences. ESIIL’s vision is grounded in the conviction that innovation and breakthroughs in EDS will be precipitated by a collaborative, and curious research community enabled by open data and infrastructure, cross-sector and community partnerships, team science, and engaged learning.
  
  
The “ML for the Environment” Post-Doctoral Research Scholar is expected to produce innovative machine learning research while also representing and encouraging and interdisciplinary community of ML/AI researchers in the rapidly developing field of EDS.
  
  
**Responsibilities**
**What Your Key Responsibilities Will Be**

* Develop and implement a research project that advances machine learning methods, analysis, and/or tools for environmental data science. Examples of relevant projects may include (but are certainly not limited to): developing new machine learning models and methods for efficient and robust environmental data science, establishing new benchmark datasets that address gaps in machine learning benchmarks for environmental data science, working with community partners to develop an application-driven machine learning system centered around on-the-ground needs.
* Work collaboratively with both members of the Computer Science Department and the ESIIL network. Foster bridges between these communities, for example through collaborative research projects, working group(s), hackathon teams, or trainings for the ESIIL community.
* Contribute to the open, reproducible science and education objectives of ESIIL, which include creating and publishing well-documented datasets and codes, FAIR-compliant code workflows, or other outputs that will serve the larger ML and EDS communities.
* Effectively share research results with colleagues and the broader science community through peer-reviewed publications, presentations, and other science products.
* Interact with a cohort of ESIIL postdocs working on ML/AI applied to various environmental topics. Actively participate in the CS and ESIIL communities and help to promote a collaborative, open environmental data science network.

**Our Approach to Flexible Work**
With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply
**spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field**
with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
  
  
Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.
