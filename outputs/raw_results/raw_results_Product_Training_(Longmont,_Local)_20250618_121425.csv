At **CesiumAstro**, we are developers and pioneers of out-of-the-box communication systems for satellites, UAVs, launch vehicles, and other space and airborne platforms. We take pride in our dynamic and cross-functional work environment, which allows us to learn, develop, and engage across our organization. If you are looking for hands-on, interactive, and autonomous work, CesiumAstro is the place for you. We are actively seeking passionate, collaborative, energetic, and forward-thinking individuals to join our team.

We are looking to add a **Senior RF Engineering Technician I** to our team. If you are excited about working in a startup environment, have a strong work ethic, and are passionate about cutting-edge electronics, we would like to hear from you.

In this position, you will work closely with Cesium engineers to create antenna range and RF test setups, execute test plans, and produce timely, reliable test results. You will have the opportunity to use and maintain state-of-the-art electronics lab instrumentation, such as anechoic chambers, spectrum analyzers, VNAs, automated power supplies, and more. You will be challenged to propose and fabricate intricate test setups and procedures to increase productivity and improve test results.

Many of our products include active phased arrays. These are antenna products with active RF circuitry integrated with the antenna. This adds complexity to the test architecture, including power, digital control, and thermal effects. As such, direct experience with phased array antenna testing is preferred.

Core day-to-day activities will include aligning with engineers to test and troubleshoot complex electronics and RF circuitry from component level to system level. As such, the ability to understand and work from drawings, diagrams, schematics, and test procedures is key.

As a small company, the Cesium team “wears many hats.” Candidates should be comfortable with a varied workflow that may involve multitasking between test setup creation, test execution, lab organization, and other related tasks.
