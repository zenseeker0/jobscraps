Champion for ethical AI, ensuring every model is fair, transparent, and explainable, enhancing our capabilities without sacrificing our values.

* Forge Influential Partnerships & Drive a Data-First Culture: Act as a strategic consultant embedded within the business. You will forge deep partnerships with HR Business Partners, Centers of Excellence (Talent Acquisition, L&D, etc.), and functional business leaders to understand their challenges and provide tailored analytical support.

* AI & Machine Learning Savvy: Practical experience applying AI/ML techniques to solve real-world business problems and a passion for staying on the cutting edge of technology.

* Exceptional Storytelling Skills: An innate ability to translate complex quantitative findings into clear, concise, and actionable recommendations for executive-level audiences.

----------------------

**The anticipated salary for this role:** **$81,122 - $117,917**

**WHO WE ARE**

The Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) is made up of approximately 1,300 sworn officers and approximately 650 support personnel. The Police Department was established in 1922, and today is responsible for providing service to a County with a population of over one million people.

**WHO WE ARE** **LOOKING FOR**

We are seeking an exceptionally talented and emotionally intelligent Management and Budget Specialist III to join the Montgomery County Police Department’s Management and Budget Division. The ideal candidate will be a strategic thinker and natural collaborator, equally comfortable engaging in rigorous financial analysis and building trusted relationships with colleagues across all levels of the organization.

The successful applicant must bring a balanced profile: sharp analytical acumen paired with excellent interpersonal skills. This includes a demonstrated ability to interpret, synthesize, and visualize complex data and budgetary information in a manner that is both insightful and actionable—especially through advanced tools such as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power BI. The ideal candidate is someone who thrives in an environment where innovation, diplomacy, and clarity of communication are just as critical as technical rigor.

We are particularly interested in professionals with experience navigating complex governmental organizations—whether at the federal, state, or local level—who are accustomed to working within highly structured environments, managing sensitive information, and building consensus among both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

During the full tenure of the probationary period, the selected candidate will be required to report to the office every day to build foundational knowledge, foster relationships, and engage directly with internal stakeholders. After successful completion of the probationary period, a hybrid work schedule may be considered, with a minimum requirement of three days on-site each week. As the sworn officers of the Montgomery County Police Department are not permitted to telework, we view consistent in-person presence as essential to providing them with the highest level of customer service and responsiveness.

------------------------

As a Management and Budget Specialist III, you will serve as a senior-level budget analyst and program strategist for the Montgomery County Police Department. You will directly support the Department’s executive leadership by conducting data-driven budget planning, program evaluation, and decision support across a full range of fiscal, operational, and policy-related domains. This includes serving as a key internal consultant for major budget initiatives and helping to modernize how we tell the story of our data.

Your role will focus on leveraging advanced data tools—especially Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power BI—to design interactive dashboards and data visualizations that enhance budget transparency, support operational decision-making, and drive strategic alignment across the Department. Your work will help translate thousands of data points into compelling insights that influence resource allocation, staffing models, capital planning, and more.

**Key responsibilities include:**

* Leading the formulation, presentation, execution, and monitoring of multi-million-dollar operating and capital budgets in alignment with departmental goals.

* Designing and maintaining interactive financial dashboards using Power BI and other data tools to visualize trends, forecast needs, and present actionable insights.

* Serving as the primary liaison between the Budget Division and assigned operational units, synthesizing their input into strategic recommendations and ensuring compliance with fiscal policies.

* Analyzing financial and operational performance data to support staffing, procurement, and programmatic decisions—including return-on-investment and cost-benefit analysis for new initiatives.

* Preparing briefing materials, narrative justifications, and analytic reports for the Police Chief, Assistant Chiefs, County Executive staff, County Council, and accreditation bodies.

* Reviewing and reconciling expenditures, purchase orders, and personnel allocations using Oracle eBusiness and Business Intelligence reporting platforms.

* Supporting efforts to refine and modernize departmental financial policies and internal control processes, with a focus on increasing efficiency, accountability, and alignment with best practices.

* Translating complex financial and operational data into plain language for non-technical stakeholders; facilitating meetings and presentations that promote mutual understanding and collaborative problem-solving.

* Providing ad hoc analysis and decision support to Department leadership on urgent or emerging issues involving fiscal and operational planning.

This position may occasionally require participation in meetings or events outside standard business hours or at offsite locations.

During the duration of the probationary period by the employee will be on-site. No telework or hybrid work opportunities will be offered until the successful completion of the applicant's probationary period.

  

**Minimum Qualifications**
--------------------------

  

**Experience:** Three (3) years or professional experience reviewing and monitoring operating and/or capital budgets, including analysis of and reporting on management and programmatic issues having budgetary implications.

Job Description

Value Realization Leadership

Co-lead the design, implementation, and governance of a new, outcome-centric Value Realization methodology for Guidewire implementations, shifting away from traditional delivery toward a business impact-focused approach.

Institutionalize the methodology through playbooks, training, and tools used by business consultants and client-facing teams.

Continuously evaluate, evolve, and improve the methodology based on market trends, customer feedback, and business outcomes.

Practice Development & Thought Leadership

Define and execute the global strategy for the Guidewire Business Consulting practice, aligning with company goals and customer needs.

Build frameworks, best practices, and methods that demonstrate Guidewire’s differentiated business value.

Partner with other practice leads to develop and deliver an enablement curriculum aligned with our new methodology, empowering consultants to become trusted advisors.

Talent Strategy & Methodology Steepening

Lead the development of a globally distributed team, primarily composed of Business Architects. Ensure all team members are fully trained in the new Value Realization methodology and capable of delivering outcome-centric consulting engagements.

Recruit, develop, and retain a team that combines insurance industry experience with consulting rigor.

Foster a culture of business-first thinking, data-driven insights, and client empathy.

Encourage specialization in market segments such as London Market, Global Commercial Lines, and Cloud Transformation.

Practice Performance Management

Establish KPIs tied to client business value, practice profitability, and staff development.

Continuously analyze performance, including adoption and impact of the new methodology, and drive improvements through operational excellence.

Monitor industry shifts and client expectations to iterate on service offerings and maintain competitive advantage.

Client Engagement & Relationship Management

Build deep executive relationships with global insurance clients. Position Guidewire as a strategic partner committed to long-term success.

Collaborate with Sales and Customer Success to identify and lead opportunities for business transformation consulting, upsells, and cross-sells, including with our Consulting Partner ecosystem.

Oversee engagement quality and customer satisfaction across all regions.

Champion the customer voice in strategic decision-making within the practice.

Delivery Oversight & Strategic Project Involvement

Provide executive oversight of transformation programs where business consulting is critical to value delivery.

Maintain partial utilization (~40-60% annually) during early phases to personally lead or shape key accounts, mentor leaders, and ensure successful pilot projects of the new methodology.

Work closely with PMO and delivery teams to ensure projects are scoped, managed, and executed to deliver measurable outcomes.

People Leadership

Inspire and guide a global team of Practice Managers, Business Architects, and Senior Consultants.

Foster a high-performance culture with strong collaboration, ownership, and career development.

Serve as a role model and coach, helping team members build both technical fluency and business acumen.

Promote inclusivity, engagement, and excellence in delivery.

Qualifications

15+ years of experience in consulting, professional services, or enterprise transformation roles, with a focus on insurance and/or SaaS platforms.

Strong preference for candidates who have:

Worked directly in the business of insurance (e.g., underwriting, claims, operations).

Spent time in a top-tier management consulting firm or a boutique consultancy focused on financial services.

Guidewire InsuranceSuite knowledge or experience (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, ClaimCenter), including implementation and transformation programs.

Proven success leading practice strategy, new methodology development, or global capability building.

Extensive experience engaging with senior client stakeholders to drive strategic conversations, roadmap planning, and outcome realization.

Demonstrated ability to scale global teams, lead through ambiguity, and influence cross-functionally.

Advanced degree in business, technology, or insurance-related field preferred.

Who We Are

We are the first publicly-traded biotech or pharmaceutical company to take the form of a public benefit corporation. Our public benefit purpose is to provide a brighter future for patients through the development of novel pharmaceutical therapies; and technologies that expand the availability of transplantable organs.

United Therapeutics (Nasdaq: UTHR) seeks to travel down the corridors of indifference to develop treatments for rare, deadly diseases. We were founded in 1996 by a family seeking a cure for their daughter’s pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Today, we have six FDA-approved therapies that treat PAH, pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) and neuroblastoma, a rare pediatric cancer. Our near-term pipeline seeks to develop additional therapies for PAH and pulmonary fibrosis (PF).

The cure for end-stage life-threatening diseases like PAH, PH-ILD, PF, and many others is an organ transplant, but only a small percentage of donated organs are available to address the vast need. For this reason, we are working to create manufactured organs to address the shortage of kidneys, hearts, lungs, and livers available for transplant. We believe an unlimited supply of tolerable, transplantable organs will eliminate the transplant waiting list and cure end-stage organ diseases for which transplant is not currently an option.

**About Us:**

For over 35 years, TERREPOWER (formerly BBB Industries) has been a leader in sustainable manufacturing, driving the circular economy by extending the life of essential products in the automotive and industrial markets.

  

Founded in 1987 in Daphne, Alabama by the Bigler family, TERREPOWER began as a small regional remanufacturer of starters and alternators. Our commitment to quality and innovation quickly earned us a reputation as a trusted name in the automotive industry.

  

Recognizing new challenges and opportunities, in 2019 we set our sights on EV battery upcycling-addressing one of the industry’s most pressing issues. Our engineering team pioneered solutions to extend EV battery life, pushing the boundaries of sustainable innovation.

  

Recognizing that demand for solar panels would exceed availability and 100,000 tons of waste would potentially go into landfills by 2035, our team searched for an innovative way to upcycle solar panels. With an eye on the future, we developed ways to upcycle solar panels.

  

Rooted in family and community values, we’re proud to have second-generation employees contributing to our legacy. Backed by Clearlake Capital, we’ve expanded our footprint into Europe with facilities in Spain, Italy, Denmark, Germany and Poland. We now sustainably manufacture and supply an assortment of nondiscretionary repair parts across more than 90 countries.

  

As we move forward under the TERREPOWER name, we remain committed to the same values that have always defined us: entrepreneurship, teamwork, customer-centered, sustainability, safety.

  

**Why Join Us?**

When you join our team, you become part of a company that is redefining how essential products are made, reused and repurposed to reduce waste and maximize resources.

Here’s what sets us apart:

* Purpose-Driven Work – Every day, your work will contribute to extending the useful life of essential products, keeping vehicles on the road and critical systems running.
* Innovative Mindset – We encourage creative problem-solving and bold ideas to push the boundaries of what is possible.
* Global Reach, Local Impact – With operations in North America and Europe, we have a global presence but remain deeply connected to the communities we serve.
* Growth & Development – Whether you’re on the production floor, in engineering, or part of our corporate team, we invest in your success through training, mentorship, and career advancement opportunities.
* A Culture of Collaboration – Rooted in teamwork and shared values, our employees work together to tackle challenges and drive meaningful change.

Please note that our organization will not extend a job offer without prior communication with our recruiting team, hiring managers and a formal interview process.","Hospitals and Health Care","https://www.linkedin.com/company/interwell-health","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQHtMEWw-jRLJA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1668114128364/interwell_health_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=JIqL9_eTjRMTzaC0slvsAEgZOMy68MmkTrGw4Crj2LI","","","","","","","","","","","","2025-06-18 12:45:23.757210","Customer Insights Analyst (USA, Remote)"
