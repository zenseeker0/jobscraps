* Translate complex data and technical concepts into actionable recommendations that are easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand and act upon

**Location:** Planning and Analysis – BPS

**Reports to**: Director of Planning and Analysis

**BPS is hiring a new analyst to join our team and expand our capacity to predict student enrollment trends, match academic programs to neighborhood needs, and to help the organization plan more thoughtfully. This is a unique opportunity to enter a large, urban school district and influence the way we serve our students.**

**The Organization**

Founded in 1647, Boston Public Schools (BPS) is the oldest public school district in the country. With approximately 49,000 students from over 114 different countries, and a budget of approximately $1.1 billion, BPS is the largest school district in Massachusetts and is one of the most diverse as well. BPS has been recognized as one of the top urban school districts in the United States; in 2006, it was awarded the Broad Prize for Urban Education as the most improved urban school district in the nation.

**The Team**

The Planning and Analysis team consists of a small group of dedicated data strategists whose work focuses on how students flow throughout the district. We partner with external and internal teams to try to manage the unpredictable: where, when, for which program and at what grade level will students enroll in our schools. We need someone who can join our creative team to develop new and thoughtful ways to understand student enrollment.

We approach this work in a variety of ways, including: redesigning and automating reporting and other business processes; analyzing the impact of and making recommendations regarding potential policy changes; leading analytic projects in support of long-term planning within the district; and working with cross-functional teams to ensure new policies are implemented successfully. Our work is project rather than department based, so the new Data Analyst will have the opportunity to work in multiple areas including student assignment and choice, school and academic design, projecting future year enrollment, and long-term master enrollment planning. In addition, our work is very collaborative, so this is a great opportunity to work closely with a group of motivated and highly skilled data strategists as you advance your analytical, visualization and presentation skills.

**Ideal Candidates**

Candidates should have a demonstrated history of infusing the following traits into their work:

* **Curiosity** - We need people to help our organization drive *improvement*. We feel that this requires a healthy desire to discover how and why things work the way they do. We also want candidates to be able to look for those explanations in data – and anything else that will help.
* **Quantitative Orientation** – Some people think that everything is measurable, that all information can have a more precise and reliable measurement. This is who we want on our team; someone whose approach to everything is rigorous, inquisitive, and analytical.
* **Persistence** – You will have to deal with messy datasets and new and evolving problems in an organization that is learning how to use data effectively. We need you to be able to work through a problem until it is solved, not until you reach a road block.
* **Technical Skills** – If quantitative orientation is about a candidate’s will to use data, this trait is about the skill. We need someone who is trained in computer science, statistics, mathematics, and/or economics. But we also want someone who is constantly acquiring technical skills and understands the value of a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving.
* **Vision** – This role is about more than just using quantitative skills to answer other people’s questions. We need someone who can help identify problems and opportunities, and who knows how to ask the right questions to address them.
* **Teamwork** – We believe that excellent teams, composed of high-performing team members, can have an enormous impact. New team members are valued for their diverse experiences and commitment to service. They must also continuously seek input from a diverse set of perspectives and think critically about the impact of their work.

**RESPONSIBILITIES:**

* Collaborate on and develop tools to improve the methodology for projecting future year enrollment. Review and evaluate feedback from school leaders and provide supporting analyses to help understand enrollment patterns.
* Perform analysis to better understand trends underlying enrollment dynamics within the district and in support of long-term enrollment planning.
* Leverage data and various databases to improve decision-making, understand trends and create management tools for school and district leaders.
* Partner with school leaders in understanding analyses and collecting needed data in order to develop school-specific strategic enrollment plans.
* Design and execute analyses to assess the impact of potential policy changes. Inform the discussion with important findings and recommendations in formal memos and/or presentations for internal and external audiences.
* Respond to both immediate and longer-term data requests with key insights and thoughtful analysis.

**QUALIFICATIONS**

* Bachelor’s degree required. Master’s degree is preferred.
* Excellent analytical ability. Formal training in computer science, statistics or a related field preferred.
* Project management skills and strong orientation toward teamwork and collaboration.
* Experience translating data into easy-to-interpret, actionable reports, presentations, and findings.
* Advanced mastery of Microsoft Excel required.
* Familiarity with at least one analytical software platform (such as STATA, R, Tableau, SPSS, SQL) or at least one coding language is required, with a preference for candidates with knowledge of R and STATA.
* Candidates with skills or experience in geospatial analysis, are highly encouraged to apply.
* Current authorization to work in the United States - Candidates must have such authorization by their first day of employment

**Terms:** Managerial Tier C51, Full-Time

**Note:** *Occasional weekend and evening work is required.*

*The Boston Public Schools, in accordance with its nondiscrimination policies, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, age, criminal record, physical or mental disability, pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions, homelessness, sex/gender, gender identity, religion, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, genetics, natural or protective hairstyle, military status, immigration status, English language proficiency, or any other factor prohibited by law in its programs and activities.

Millions of people around the world come to our platform to find creative ideas, dream about new possibilities and plan for memories that will last a lifetime. At Pinterest, we’re on a mission to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, and that starts with the people behind the product.
  
  
Discover a career where you ignite innovation for millions, transform passion into growth opportunities, celebrate each other’s unique experiences and embrace the flexibility to do your best work. Creating a career you love? It’s Possible.
  
  
Pinterest brings millions of people the inspiration to create a life they love. To evolve this mission our product and engineering teams need to innovate - much of this innovation is driven through machine learning, and critical to understanding how innovation on the product will change our business is through measurement. Data labels play a key role in unlocking both of these, and the rate and scale at which we can obtain reliable labels limits our speed of innovation.
  
  
**This Role Brings Together 3 Critical Science Efforts**

* The notion of asking qualified raters to answer questions about content, whether it’s scoring its relevance to a particular context, review captions for pins, or determining whether or where certain attributes are present in an image, has played a critical role in our evaluation and machine learning efforts across Pinterest. However, utilizing human evaluators to complete these tasks at scale have limitations - it can be time-intensive to accurately define the tasks, costly to get large volumes of labels, and slow to collect the data.
* Surveys of our Pinners offer a unique mechanism to gather the perspective of our Pinners on questions we have about the platform and content; a Pinner’s perspective can be different to that of a human rater observing the same content because of the unique context they possess.
* Advancements in Generative AI have opened up a wealth of opportunities for improvements in productivity, and we’ve only scratched the surface of its capabilities in the labeling space. Early results show strong promise for the role it can play in these tasks, reducing the time and cost of our labeling efforts, focusing our surveys and human rater efforts on higher value problems, and improving the accuracy of our learnings.

We’re looking for an accomplished Data Science leader to lead a small, high-performing team, to unlock a new level of capabilities in our efforts across labeling, surveys, and iterative GenAI tasks. From statistical approaches that can better inform the labels we collect to prototypes to automatically craft prompts for LLMs to address the needed tasks, this team will lead a key strategic component of the data science organization innovating on data platforms across the company.
  
  
**What You’ll Do**
We are looking for an experienced and highly capable Data Scientist to help us drive step function improvements in our data labeling capabilities at Pinterest. In this role, you will:
  
  

* Create and realize a strategic vision for the science investments across the labeling, survey and GenAI tooling space, emphasizing rigor alongside value-creation, and partner with product and engineering leaders to build a unified vision for these platforms.
* Build, inspire and grow a small high performing team of data scientists who are passionate about this space that will shape and execute on the strategic vision.
* Apply deep scientific knowledge and domain expertise to understand opportunities and prototype solutions that demonstrate substantial improvements in velocity, accuracy and cost-efficiency, measure and mitigate biases, and amplify the impact employees can have when utilizing survey results, data labels, or GenAI prompts in their investments.
* Translate ambiguous business challenges into actionable plans and ensure that your team is consistently producing trustworthy and high-quality technical output that influence the business.
* Communicate complex analytical findings and insights to both technical and non-technical audiences in a clear and concise manner.
* Collaborate cross-functionally with customers to understand their problems and pain-points, and with engineers to scale successful prototypes to become integral components of the platform.

**What We’re Looking For**

* 10+ years of combined post-graduate academic and industry experience applying scientific methods to solve real-world problems on large-scale data
* Experience in managing teams of data scientists, fostering a culture of innovation, high performance, collaboration, and continuous improvement
* Hands-on experience as an individual contributor using a deep understanding of scientific methods applied to data to drive business decisions
* Demonstrated execution and impact on initiatives that cross multiple product areas and interface with leadership and product teams with a track record of influencing leaders and peers using data
* Proven track record of crafting high quality algorithmic code and identifying opportunities for efficiency and performance improvements through statistical methods
* Demonstrated execution and impact on cross-functional initiatives, strong communication skills, and a track record of influencing leaders and peers using data
* Self-propelled continuous learner who keeps up with new tools and methodologies and builds prototypes with concepts learned
* Strong business and product sense with the ability to shape ambiguous questions into well-defined analyses and success metrics that drive business decisions
* The ideal candidates will have experience with labeling platforms, measurement, and developing high quality prompts for LLMs

**Relocation Statement:**

* This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.
* This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 3-5 times/quarter and therefore can be situated anywhere in the country.

In an effort to provide greater transparency, we are sharing the base salary range for this position. The position is also eligible for equity.
