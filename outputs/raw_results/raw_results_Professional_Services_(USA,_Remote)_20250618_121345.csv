Through our three programs (Employment, Education, and Career Services), we provide dedicated support and a safe space for young people to explore career opportunities and build the skills and confidence they need to achieve economic mobility.

To serve our Oakland Employment Program we are currently hiring a Workforce Development Advocate.

**How We Show Up:** Our values—Respect, Trust, Collaboration, Learning, and Innovation—guide everything we do. We are committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive community where young people feel valued, empowered, and equipped with the skills and opportunities to succeed. Our Workforce Development Advocates lead with compassion for the youth we serve and hold a strong belief in their ability to secure and sustain high quality employment as a pathway to economic mobility.

**About the Job:** Workforce Development Advocates implement a holistic, trauma-informed approach to supporting participants in workforce readiness. This role focuses on guiding participants in practicing and applying essential soft skills for employment as well as job readiness coaching as they complete internships. Advocates serve as a key link between youth and site partners to ensure participants have the resources and support needed to not only succeed in their roles, but successfully transition into long-term, paid job opportunities.

Additionally, Workforce Advocates will partner with New Door’s Transition Services team to connect those who are interested in sector and/or career-based employment. Our research-based program aligns with known predictive milestones for economic mobility: create enabling conditions (e.g., establish safe and trusting relationships), build assets (e.g., resume and interview skills), and promote agency (e.g., goal setting). Workforce Advocates work closely with instructors and other team members to provide a wholly integrated experience for program participants.

**A current Advocate described their work and role this way:**

“What I like about working at New Door is that I get the opportunity to give back to the next generation of my city and see some of myself in the youth we serve. I benefited a lot from mentorship, and seeing that from the other side has been humbling.”

New Door’s Uptown Oakland office is a comfortable, welcoming space, equipped to keep staff and clients protected from transmission of infectious disease. Office space is open-plan and shared with a collaborative, respectful team.

**Who You Are:** If you thrive in a mission-driven environment where relationships matter, diversity of thought is valued, new ideas are encouraged, teamwork is expected, and growth is supported, you’ll find a lot of synergy with New Door’s ethos.

This includes: providing legal oversight to proposals and procurement, advising on data rights and contract structures, giving legal guidance to existing business areas, and crafting legal and business strategies. The Legal Team partners closely with customers, outside counsel, and business partners across the organization to support business development and day-to-day legal operations.  
  
Anduril is a fast-growing company. Consistent with this fast growth, members of Anduril’s Legal Team must be resourceful, creative, and eager to take ownership of complex matters. The Associate General Counsel will be expected to take responsibility for significant, material projects, which will have a meaningful impact on the company’s business. The Associate General Counsel role requires creativity and resourcefulness to navigate the US Government’s complex procurement and compliance rules, with a singular focus on helping Anduril deploy its path-making technology into operational settings for the United States and its allies. In addition to helping capture and execute new government deals, you will work on all other aspects of Anduril’s business, from negotiating license and services agreements, to bid protests and litigation, handling intellectual property, and advising on statutory and regulatory requirements. Experience across all of these areas is not expected, but a willingness to learn and adapt is.  
  
Our team is passionate about the law and policy of defense technology and you should have an independent interest in the key issues in this field. Anduril fosters a diverse, collaborative, culture with tremendous opportunities for ownership and professional growth.

* Be a key member of Anduril’s small, dynamic Legal Team.
* Drive customer growth by executing new government contracts and growing existing ones. Use your expertise in federal procurement law to help the Business Development, Proposal, and Engineering Teams efficiently capture new contracts, grow existing contracts, and set up follow-on opportunities for future contracts. Assist in the strategy development for new business.
* Manage relationships with procurement office representatives at Government agencies. High-trust professional relationships with Government contracting and procurement offices are critical to Anduril’s continued success, and you will be called upon to develop and foster these relationships throughout your tenure.
* Provide legal counsel and day-to-day management of the entire acquisitions lifecycle. Oversee and evaluate major proposals, monitor large contracts, lead or assist in key negotiations, resolve performance issues, identify risks and mitigations, and ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and policies.
* Work on all legal aspects of Anduril’s business, from negotiating license and services agreements, to bid protests and litigation, to handling deal-related intellectual property, compliance, and employment matters. You will represent the legal team in relationships with outside counsel, vendors, engineers, executives, customers, and regulators.

### **REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS**

* 8+ years of relevant post-college work in government, military, engineering, or law
* 5+ years of work on US Government contracts matters, preferably with a law firm or the government (more senior lawyers are encouraged to apply)
* A solid understanding of the government procurement process, particularly contract vehicles and types (including OTAs, commercial contracts, and CAS-covered contracts) and data rights issues
* The judgment and initiative required to own multiple projects from end-to-end, whether guiding the Business Development Team through the lifecycle of a deal or handling unexpected legal issues that may arise in defense or start-up companies
* Strong communication, writing, and interpersonal skills
* Quick learner and independent performer, able to contribute to the broader start-up legal function, including topics that may be completely new to you
* Licensed to practice law in CA or DC
* US Person with, or eligible to receive, a Top Secret Clearance

Chaque situation nécessite une réponse adaptée, et les solutions sont fournies en fonction des besoins uniques du client.
* Multi-tâches pour une résolution précise des problèmes - Résoudre les problèmes des clients rapidement et avec précision en utilisant les informations contenues dans les diverses applications commerciales, les ressources et les plates-formes clients soutenues par l'AF. Cela implique de naviguer dans différents systèmes, d'examiner les fiches d'information spécifiques aux clients pour les procédures opérationnelles standard et les détails des comptes, tout en naviguant efficacement dans plusieurs écrans et systèmes pour récupérer les données pertinentes, entrer des requêtes de recherche et gérer les tâches simultanément, le tout en temps réel, pour résoudre les cas et les documents de manière efficace et précise.
* Communication professionnelle et empathique - Conduisez toutes vos interactions avec professionnalisme, en maintenant un ton calme, poli et empathique. Expliquez clairement la situation et décrivez les mesures que vous prendrez pour résoudre le problème.
* Désescalade et contrôle de la qualité - Gérer et désescalader efficacement les frustrations des clients. Les appels sont contrôlés à des fins d'assurance qualité et de développement des performances. Les agents doivent donc faire preuve de professionnalisme sous pression et contribuer à une expérience client positive.
* Documentation précise et opportune - Documenter rapidement et précisément toutes les interactions dans les systèmes de l'entreprise. Il s'agit notamment de saisir la raison du contact, les détails partagés avec les clients ou les équipes d'escalade, les actions entreprises, les résolutions et les suivis nécessaires. Il peut être nécessaire de saisir des tickets et de les attribuer à d'autres services, qui peuvent également être contactés en temps réel au cours de l'interaction. En outre, des captures d'écran peuvent être nécessaires pour la documentation du dossier. Veillez à ce que toute la documentation soit complétée pendant le contact lui-même ou dans les deux minutes qui suivent la fin du contact, afin d'être prêt à répondre à la prochaine demande.
* Communication interne efficace et suivi - Assurer le suivi des équipes internes si nécessaire en utilisant le courrier électronique et les notes de cas dans le CRM. Veiller à ce que toutes les communications soient claires, professionnelles et grammaticalement correctes. Fournir des mises à jour et des résolutions basées sur les interactions avec les clients, y compris les détails de la recherche ou de l'escalade.
* Apprentissage et formation continus - Participer à la formation requise pour améliorer le soutien à la clientèle et rester informé des mises à jour du système, des changements de produits et de l'évolution des besoins et des services des clients. Il peut s'agir de cours en ligne, de sessions en direct ou virtuelles, et de l'examen de documents de référence envoyés par courrier électronique pour garantir la conformité avec les processus et les normes de service de la FA. Étant donné les fréquentes mises à jour des produits et des processus, se tenir informé et développer ses compétences peut également nécessiter de consulter le centre d'aide/de ressources pour accéder aux dernières informations et lignes directrices.
* Contribuer à la base de connaissances et à l'amélioration - Contribuer au centre de référence des connaissances de l'entreprise en aidant à améliorer les ressources pour les cas futurs. Partager les idées et promouvoir le contenu qui aide à l'amélioration du service à la clientèle dans l'ensemble de l'organisation.
* Rythme de travail et gestion des performances - Gérer le rythme de travail et la qualité pour atteindre les objectifs de performance, tels que le volume d'appels, la durée des appels, les scores d'assurance qualité, la satisfaction des clients, le respect des processus, la confidentialité et le professionnalisme. Agir en fonction du retour d'information des superviseurs et des mesures de performance pour améliorer en permanence l'efficacité et l'efficience, en veillant à respecter les normes de l'entreprise, les exigences réglementaires et les meilleures pratiques.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.
  
  
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.
  
  
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

  
**The Role**
  

The Strategic Account Management organization is looking for a tenured customer-facing professional to manage relationships with some of Square’s largest sellers and grow our Strategic Account Management program.

They engage customers and influence internal stakeholders through excellent storytelling, organization, and persistence. They are comfortable leveraging technical frameworks for product solutions and are strongly tuned into commerce trends. They consistently identify “mutual win” opportunities, while navigating complex projects and negotiations. They are driven by serving customers, can work independently, and thrive in ambiguous environments.

  

*You will:*

  

  
* Manage a book of 50 Strategic Sellers
  
* Grow account-based revenue via use-case expansion opportunities, cross-sell opportunities, and customized seller onboarding experiences
  
* Identify opportunities for technical Square solutions to address existing customer needs; project manage the execution of these technical solutions in collaboration with cross-functional teams
  
* Partner with Strategic Account Executives on high-growth deals
  
* Negotiate contracts for use-case expansion and retention of your sellers
  
* Serve as the voice of the upmarket seller with Product Teams
  
* Provide white glove client service to ensure resolution of seller issues
  
* Inform operations and program design for this segment at scale
  

  

*You have:*

  

  
* Consistent over-performance on key metrics
  
* 5+ years of sales or account management experience
  
* Remarkable discovery skills with customers
  
* A technical solutioning framework, including the ability to conduct requirements gathering
  
* Proven experience managing projects internally with engineering, product and finance teams
  
* Contract and/or pricing negotiations experience with external senior stakeholders

**Job Description**
**Value Realization Leadership**

* Co-lead the design, implementation, and governance of a new, outcome-centric Value Realization methodology for Guidewire implementations, shifting away from traditional delivery toward a business impact-focused approach.

* Lead the Business Consulting team’s ownership of pre-sales, working in tight alignment with Sales, Customer Success, and Product teams.
* Shape client transformation journeys from the earliest interactions, ensuring Guidewire is positioned as a strategic enabler of outcomes—not just a software vendor.
* Contribute to opportunity shaping and executive communications with prospective clients - often in conjunction with our Systems Integration partners - translating business cases to transformation strategy and roadmap design.

**Practice Development & Thought Leadership**

* Define and execute the global strategy for the Guidewire Business Consulting practice, aligning with company goals and customer needs.
* Build frameworks, best practices, and methods that demonstrate Guidewire’s differentiated business value.
* Represent Guidewire in industry forums, analyst briefings, and executive roundtables to drive thought leadership in insurance transformation.
* Partner with other practice leads to develop and deliver an enablement curriculum aligned with our new methodology, empowering consultants to become trusted advisors.

**Talent Strategy & Methodology Steepening**

* Recruit, develop, and retain a team that combines insurance industry experience with consulting rigor.
* Foster a culture of business-first thinking, data-driven insights, and client empathy.

* Continuously analyze performance, including adoption and impact of the new methodology, and drive improvements through operational excellence.

**Client Engagement & Relationship Management**

* Build deep executive relationships with global insurance clients. Position Guidewire as a strategic partner committed to long-term success.
* Collaborate with Sales and Customer Success to identify and lead opportunities for business transformation consulting, upsells, and cross-sells, including with our Consulting Partner ecosystem.
* Oversee engagement quality and customer satisfaction across all regions.
* Champion the customer voice in strategic decision-making within the practice.

**Delivery Oversight & Strategic Project Involvement**

* Provide executive oversight of transformation programs where business consulting is critical to value delivery.
* Maintain partial utilization (~40-60% annually) during early phases to personally lead or shape key accounts, mentor leaders, and ensure successful pilot projects of the new methodology.
* Work closely with PMO and delivery teams to ensure projects are scoped, managed, and executed to deliver measurable outcomes.

**People Leadership**

* Inspire and guide a global team of Practice Managers, Business Architects, and Senior Consultants.
* Foster a high-performance culture with strong collaboration, ownership, and career development.
* Serve as a role model and coach, helping team members build both technical fluency and business acumen.
* Promote inclusivity, engagement, and excellence in delivery.

**Qualifications**

* 15+ years of experience in consulting, professional services, or enterprise transformation roles, with a focus on insurance and/or SaaS platforms.
* Strong preference for candidates who have:

+ Worked directly in the business of insurance (e.g., underwriting, claims, operations).
+ Spent time in a top-tier management consulting firm or a boutique consultancy focused on financial services.

* Guidewire InsuranceSuite knowledge or experience (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, ClaimCenter), including implementation and transformation programs.
* Proven success leading practice strategy, new methodology development, or global capability building.
* Extensive experience engaging with senior client stakeholders to drive strategic conversations, roadmap planning, and outcome realization.
* Strong analytical, communication, and storytelling skills. Ability to build business cases, define KPIs, and articulate customer value in compelling terms.
* Demonstrated ability to scale global teams, lead through ambiguity, and influence cross-functionally.
