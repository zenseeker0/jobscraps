Revscale is a high-growth AI strategy and implementation company helping enterprises adopt custom agentic systems to drive digital transformation across their core functions. We combine proprietary agent libraries with tailored automation layers to deliver business-critical outcomes—fast. After two years of building, we’ve achieved substantial growth and are rapidly scaling with flagship clients across insurance, financial services, and enterprise franchising.

We're not selling hype—we're solving real problems with practical AI that delivers ROI within weeks, not quarters.

**Why We’re Hiring**

We’re looking for a high-performing **Enterprise Sales Lead** to take point on our next phase of growth. As Revscale evolves into the go-to partner for AI transformation across mid-market and enterprise organizations, we need a player-coach who can build, close, and scale revenue with the precision of a founder and the discipline of a GTM strategist.

**We’re hiring you because:**

* You understand that selling “AI” isn’t about selling software—it’s about solving pain.

* You thrive in high-context, consultative environments and can co-create solutions with C-suite buyers.

* You know how to build pipeline through modern GTM motions and can execute outbound with the right mix of narrative, automation, and hustle.

* You’re comfortable selling what doesn’t exist—yet—and you love shaping deals as much as closing them.

**What You’ll Be Doing**

This is not just another AE role. You’ll be responsible for:

* **Own the full sales cycle** from outbound prospecting to discovery, scoping, closing, and handoff

* **Sell custom and semi-custom AI deployments** to enterprise buyers across verticals (think: automating internal operations, driving revenue, eliminating overhead)

* **Run a hybrid GTM motion:** email + LinkedIn outreach, network-driven meetings, pitch decks, and discovery sessions

* **Partner with our founders** to shape how we price, package, and present our offering to different ICPs

* **Help build the foundation** for a repeatable, scalable GTM system by giving feedback on playbooks, tools, messaging, and more

* **Drive strategic relationships** that expand into multi-year, multi-line-of-business deals

**You Might Be a Fit If You:**

* Have **5–8 years in enterprise SaaS, consulting, or agency sales**, with a strong track record of 6– and 7–figure deals

* Have **sold bespoke, consultative solutions** (bonus: in digital transformation, AI/ML, automation, or systems integration)

* Are **founder-minded**—you operate like an owner and never wait to be told what to do

* Love **sales engineering**—you’re excited by complex problems, whiteboard sessions, and co-building roadmaps

* Are **fluent in GTM tools** like HubSpot, Apollo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and understand how to make automation your sidekick

* Can **translate business problems into technical solutions**, and vice versa

* Know how to sell to **multiple stakeholders**—from VP Ops to CTO to CEO—and keep deals moving through ambiguity

* Are obsessed with the intersection of **AI and business outcomes**

**What Success Looks Like**

* In your first 30 days: you’re running calls with our founders, absorbing our strategy, and shaping the pitch

* In 90 days: you’ve sourced and closed 2–3 pilot deals, built strong pipeline, and influenced our GTM

* In 6 months: you’re leading multiple accounts, expanding SOWs, and helping shape the sales team’s DNA

**Why You’ll Love This Role**

* **You’ll shape the category.** We’re building a new go-to-market model for agent-based AI transformation—your fingerprints will be all over it.

* **You’ll sell meaningful work.** We don’t do fluff. We help companies operate 10x more efficiently through real, working AI.

* **You’ll work with elite builders.** Our team includes top-tier product minds, automation architects, and systems engineers.

* **You’ll grow with us.** We’re scaling to $10M+ ARR and beyond. Early impact will be rewarded with equity, ownership, and opportunity.

If you're excited by the idea of **selling strategy, not just software**, and want to help **reshape how enterprises adopt AI**, we want to meet you.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.
